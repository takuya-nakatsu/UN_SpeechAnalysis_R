the Assembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State Council of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a self-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani military personnel — army, plain-clothes personnel and armed Taliban — are reported to have been positioned in the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border town of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound for an attack on Badakhshan province. On behalf of my delegation, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the major task of presiding over the important millennium session of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on his excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, which set the stage for the Millennium Summit. Three years ago, I stood before the Assembly and stated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in Afghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and answer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the dark and ominous movement known as the Taliban, which, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded Afghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the General Assembly indeed has to answer major questions. One among many is the silence the world has chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their Pakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism, which has led to the abject misery of the Afghan nation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region and beyond, is it not high time that the international community put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban processing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and inadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this view that I should like to focus my statement entirely on the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating regional and international implications, within the given time limit. 4 A question arises: what has been the result of the Talibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In an age of information and globalization, it has been a reign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in the name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms and civil liberties, massive violations of human rights, degrading and tormenting treatment of men and women, trafficking of women and girls, the forced separation of women from their menfolk, the random and deliberate round-up of individuals based on their ethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorchedearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of farmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the contamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch of children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of all but rudimentary religious education — for male students only — with the closure of all schools for females, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the situation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of the historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in order to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry and historical identity. The objective of the Pakistani military intelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to create instability in Central and South Asia by means of terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has instituted Mullah Omar, the militia's leader, as the undisputed Amir-ul-Mo'mineen, meaning “Commander of the faithful” not only in Afghanistan, but in theory throughout the Muslim world. The process the Pakistani military intelligence has chosen for the realization of its objective is to transform the Afghan nation into an exhausted, devastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation struggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to turn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit activities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other crimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing centres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act as the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan continues to carry out these activities under the name of Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment that such activities have led to the defamation of both the noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims throughout the world. In short, the Afghan nation has become the direct victim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani military's hegemonic interests in the region. These diabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military intelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution, while the implied risk and perilous consequences for the very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are overlooked. As the world is gradually awakening to the creeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that some “civilized” nations, on certain occasions, have preferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban, an entity which has failed to meet the minimum standard of being considered civilized, while having championed terrorism, human rights violations and crimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only Pakistan's military junta has continuously given its full blessing to the movement. At least until early May of this year, the official position of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and officials strangely claimed, was that it maintained contacts with both parties to the conflict. However, Pakistan's News Network International (NNI) news agency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez Musharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policy was “in accordance with Pakistan's national interest.” Advocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of Pakistan, the General was quoted as saying, “We have a national security interest, both demographic and geographic.” He further stated that in the realization of this security interest, “Pashtoons should be on our side and they”, meaning Pashtoons, “are represented by Taliban.” The world must know that in a flagrant violation of recognized international norms and principles and in clear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler of the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous pretext of national security interest, has claimed the right to impose a certain ethnic group through the invocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the cost of the sovereignty and political independence of Afghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and, prior to that, of the League of Nations, long before Pakistan was even born. It is important to remember that terrorist training camps operating from the Taliban-held territories of Afghanistan, including those established by the infamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has 5 been repeatedly called for by the United Nations and the entire international community, have been established by Pakistan's military intelligence through the Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks. They continue to utilize these territories as a ground for training, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements seeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the region and beyond. This is done under the guise of Islam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani hegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and activities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of the Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is high time that the Security Council, in accordance with relevant resolutions, undertook appropriate enforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the prime source of sponsorship of these activities. The Security Council, in its unanimously adopted resolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly demanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from sheltering, supporting and training terrorists and planning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other countries and that it extradite to the requesting States those indicted for committing international acts of terrorism. The recent upsurge of terrorist activities in Central Asian countries and beyond, emanating from the Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires drastic measures by the Security Council against the militia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration of the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the expansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999), which must include the end of terrorist activities in all forms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of Afghanistan, could adequately, among other things, serve the cause of peace and security in the region. Here I would like to welcome the proposal by the Republic of Uzbekistan for convening an international conference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the evil phenomenon of terrorism. In spite of the current devastating drought in Afghanistan — the most severe in 30 years — Afghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics. The production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by the Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan, account for considerable revenue, which is used to finance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to considerable transnational organized crime, while adding to the number of addicts, both at home and abroad. Among the many deliberate violations and instances of absolute disregard for international humanitarian law and the numerous crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban and their outside supporters in the year 2000, one could mention the following cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of 198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as hostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August of the United Nations mine-clearance employees affiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid that, according to the European Union, in the light of the devastating drought constituted a breach of international humanitarian law; the forced blood-drawing and organ removal of innocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in August; the forced deportation of the civilian populations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the closing down in August, as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from working, of all bakeries run by the United Nations World Food Programme in which widows were paid to make bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to other widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul alone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the north due to renewed Taliban military onslaughts. We believe that the commission of those heinous crimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to the lack of adequate response by the Security Council and the international community to bring to justice the perpetrators and others involved in incidents at Bamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in 1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings of Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military adviser to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998. It is significant to note that the Taliban continue to deprive women of their fundamental rights, including the right to education, which affects over 100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are still barred from employment by the Taliban. While the predictable results will speak for themselves, present 6 and future female generations of Afghanistan will be illiterate. The cultural and social impact of that criminal act on the country's future generations will be enormous. Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a fact well known to the international community. The hundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting alongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the Government; the mortal remains of hundreds of Pakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and identification cards obtained from their pockets; the intercepted radio transmissions; and the massive logistical support and the overt supply of large quantities of military hardware and ammunition, all prove the direct involvement of Pakistani army personnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General Rustam of Pakistan's armed forces, who is currently stationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, commands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations in the north. He has been assisted by two of bin Laden's henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them were involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and in the atrocities committed against the civilian population. It is important to mention that the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs magazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis having fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in excess of 80,000. A breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed contingents, including units from the North-West Frontier Corps and different commando units, have actively participated in battles on various occasions; Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the planning and command and control of both intelligence operations and logistical support; ex-commissioned officers in charge of tactical operations, artillery support and logistics; frontier militia units; paramilitary members of extremist terrorist groups affiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the Sepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and the so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or religious schools. Other categories of foreign fighters in Afghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and its affiliated units from around the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups from Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In addition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were educated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are dispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally, there are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons from around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon fodder. In this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan appeals to the Security Council to mandate the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an investigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report to the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani armed men and Arab fighters who are working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries. This would break the silence that has thus far encouraged further Pakistani intervention in Afghanistan. I should like to remind the Assembly that only those Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will be immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of Afghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment. One must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah indirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace initiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that peace has no place in the Taliban agenda. While striving for the realization of noble human values and principles — the institution of a democratic system, the observance of human rights, including those of women and girls, civil liberties and elections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates its firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for the formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully representative Government through a workable mechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or loya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the auspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as Pakistan continues to directly and massively intervene in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan considers the task of defending the territorial integrity, national unity and political independence of Afghanistan its immediate priority. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has high expectations that the United Nations and the international community will exert pressure on Pakistan to immediately cease its intervention in Afghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel and armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the Security Council will address the question of foreign 7 intervention, the existence of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; that the Organization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its view of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken and carried out in the name of Islam — which we believe distort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its tenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug Control Programme will assist the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and the international community will step up their efforts for an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan conflict; and that the international community will provide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and drought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I should like to mention that the current drought, the most severe in 30 years, will have tremendous humanitarian repercussions. We remain thankful for the statements made by the heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and in the General Assembly expressing their legitimate concerns over the dangers emanating from the Pakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan. We deeply appreciate and support the indefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no stone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries concerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. I should like to conclude by stating that the United Nations cannot embark on the new millennium without appropriately addressing the issues enshrined in its Charter, among others, the question of noninterference. Neither can this international body advocate globalization in its true sense when Talibanization is threatening regional stability in our part of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta will remain the prime actor in this dreadful and immense tragedy in Asia. Like many others afflicted with the Taliban plague, we wonder how far the evil threat of Talibanism will spread, how many more souls it will bury and how many new borders it must cross before the conscience of the international community is awakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate and drastic preventive measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr>\n\t<tr><td>2000</td><td>55</td><td>AGO</td><td>Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate, in particular, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise and dynamic manner in which he carried out his mandate. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish efforts to make the United Nations an increasingly effective instrument, capable of dealing with the demands of our times and finding and implementing solutions for the most pressing problems of the world. Just a few days ago, during the Millennium Summit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and expressed the need to adapt its structure for the demands and challenges of the future. During that event of transcendental importance for the lives of the people of this planet, the indispensable and irreplaceable character of the United Nations in international relations was reaffirmed. Member States reiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the United Nations as a privileged mechanism for international dialogue and cooperation in the name of peace and well-being of all peoples. Indeed, given the role of the United Nations as guarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is urgent that we begin the implementation of actions aimed at adapting its internal structure to new world realities. This will permit the Organization to deal rapidly and effectively with the main problems of the world and avoid having its members resort to solutions outside the established framework of its main organs  namely, the General Assembly and the Security Council. In recent years, the United Nations sought, through world summits, to find global solutions with broad international consensus for the many misfortunes that afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of the environment, violations of human rights and inadequate social development, among others. Various plans of action were outlined. However, the problems 12  they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have even become worse. A revision of the mechanism for implementing decisions is needed, through a revitalization and strengthening of the United Nations system, particularly that of its principal bodies, such as the Security Council. From our point of view, that body requires greater internal democracy, and its composition should reflect the current membership in the Organization and its geographic diversity. We think that, in this way, its decision-making would be faster and its performance in the area of peacekeeping and international security more effective. The persistence of a climate of insecurity and instability in a number of regions of the world cannot be attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems from weakness in the international security system. A reflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for example, in the early warning system and in the peacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not always corresponded to the desired objectives, either because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not sent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are not provided with adequate human, material and financial resources. Sometimes this is due to the ambiguity in the mission mandate itself. We recognize that the effectiveness of action in the area of peace and international security does not depend only on United Nations activities. There has to be renewed commitment on the part of each and every State. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent publication of the Brahimi report. It is our understanding that the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels should be made part of this commitment in order to eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In the particular case of the African continent, the continent most affected by the scourge of war, the illicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of support for wars incited by some rebel groups with the objective of overturning democratically elected regimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with the aim of reducing access of these conflict diamonds to the international market. My Government supports these initiatives and will provide any cooperation necessary for their implementation. Another serious issue affecting international security is the circulation and transfer of small arms that flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups. This takes place with the connivance of certain Governments and networks of transnational organized crime. The lack of international legal instruments capable of controlling transactions of these arms is stimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above all in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of conflicts and making their resolution even more difficult. According to United Nations data, the effects of these arms on civil populations are shocking. They have already resulted in more deaths than the two world wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict diamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes special importance for Angola. It is through the sale of illegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which they then undertook a large-scale military campaign aimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a procession of death and destruction, and it is the principal reason for the economic instability in Angola. This scenario is repeating itself in other regions of Africa and the world. For this reason, a solution is urgently required. The economic and social development and subsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for human rights, democracy and good governance can only be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and stability. It is in this context that my Government established, as a priority, the restoration of definitive peace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this objective, the general situation in Angola has significantly improved. It is for this reason that today we are more confident than ever of a future of peace, development and prosperity. Indeed, the war has ceased to have the same intensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict itself is moving progressively towards an end. The political and military measures undertaken by the Government have significantly reduced the ability of the rebels to wage war. These measures have also allowed the Government to resume control over nearly the entire country. More than 12,000 rebel military personnel have abandoned their arms and joined the efforts of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who persist in waging war have less and less space, and their activities are limited today to isolated armed attacks against civilian targets, the objective being to destroy and loot the people's property. 13  The military measures undertaken by the Government represent a necessary and legitimate recourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the rebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very existence of the Angolan democratic system. However, despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the total control of our national borders and the elimination of the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are having a positive impact in the search for peace, they do not constitute our only option for the resolution of armed conflict. Simultaneously, we will continue to implement other actions aimed at guaranteeing the total implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us continues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the Angolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our readiness to continue to integrate in our society all those who choose to abandon the option of war. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, still has an active role to play in the process of restoring peace in Angola, through the continued implementation and strengthening of sanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. The recent nomination by the Secretary-General of the members of the mechanism to monitor the application of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1295 (2000), will contribute to greater international vigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny bases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will extend their cooperation to that body. The significant improvement of the situation in Angola, however, has not brought an immediate end to the effects of war on the lives of the people. The humanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for that reason we appeal to the international community to increase its assistance to the needy populations. The positive evolution of the situation is not limited to the politico-military field; it has also carried over into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues on the path of economic reforms which have earned the confidence of international financial institutions. This progress translated to the recent signature of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund relating to the implementation of a monitored programme. We hope that the international community will contribute substantially through the investment of capital during the recovery phase of the Angolan economy in supporting stability and growth. Angola adopted legislation to protect foreign investment by providing incentives and guarantees. The international situation continues to be characterized by violence and tension in various parts of the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace and stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for stability and development in the central region of Africa. The situation in that neighbouring country, which shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common border with Angola, remains quite volatile and complex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if appropriate measures are not taken. The resolution of the Congolese conflict must come about, fundamentally, through the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In spite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new reading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to all the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Invading forces should withdraw completely from Congolese territory and cease immediately their support for the destabilization of that country. These conditions, in addition to the inter- Congolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base including the unequivocal recognition of the authority of the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the success of the peace process. Angola reiterates its commitment to continue to make the necessary efforts, together with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement, until a way out of the conflict is found. In Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities continues to delay the pacification of the country. Angola supports regional initiatives aimed at reactivating the peace process and condemns the attacks against United Nations personnel and forces. We support steps aimed at bringing to international justice the principal parties responsible for the atrocities committed against the people of that country. In Somalia, the progress reached at the national conference led to the re-establishment of some national institutions and moved the country closer to peace. 14  Angola encourages the continuation of these efforts and hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able to reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the international community. In the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive movement following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two parties honour their commitments under the accord and create conditions for the establishment of good- neighbourly relations and cooperation. Similarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding the resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through the implementation of the United Nations peace plan. Angola is following with particular attention the situation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and supports the efforts of the Government of that country to find a just and fair solution to the land problem that was inherited from the colonial period. In this context, we share and fully support the position expressed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land reform in Zimbabwe. In the Middle East, the question of Palestine constitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the region. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The resolution of this conflict must encompass a political compromise between the parties involved and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and other understandings reached. Less than a year ago, the people of East Timor finally succeeded in exercising their right to self- determination. Angola feels pleased and compensated by this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the countries that fought in the United Nations and other international forums for the right of the Timorese people to freely choose their own destiny. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, which is responsible for the management of the transition period, cannot permit the current climate of violence, provoked by the militias with the objective of impeding the independence of the territory, to impose itself over the will of a people that has already suffered for decades the scourge of colonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly condemns these acts of violence, which have resulted in great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola appeals to the Security Council to take appropriate steps to ensure its immediate cessation. In the past two years, the world economy has registered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook Asia. The industrial economies and the so-called emerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving considerable rates of growth. However, the present world economic order continues to be marked by sharp distortions between North and South. While the North enjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues to suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to these ills are restrictive economic measures imposed unilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one example  its principal victims are the most vulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to support the lifting of the embargo. The international goal of reducing by one half, by the year 2015, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts, above all by the wealthiest countries and international financial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary to relieve the burden of external debt, whose service payments alone absorb a large part of the financial resources of developing countries. At the same time, steps will be necessary to attenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite the fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community in international economic relations, globalization has benefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped countries. The structural adjustment programmes under way in many developing countries should take account of real necessities and specifics, because many of the measures imposed by the international financial institutions have caused serious difficulties, above all of a social nature. To conclude my remarks, I would like to call attention to the need to pay more attention to the economic situation of the African continent. This should be done in such a way as to facilitate its integration into the world market, particularly through the transfer of technology and increasing productive investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n\t<tr><td>2000</td><td>55</td><td>ALB</td><td>Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, and to express my strong conviction that, under your guidance, the work of this session will be conducted successfully. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the work carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and for his competent guidance of the previous session. At the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a sovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to making its modest contribution, in the activities of the community of countries Members of the United Nations, to greater peace, stability, security and economic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating internal political and economic stability, as well as by pursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving constructive cooperation with the countries of South- Eastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session, Albania has been taking further steps towards consolidating its democratic institutions and constitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its economy and consolidating and ensuring respect for human rights. Because of the efficient measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to the help provided by our partners, Albania is recovering from the consequences of last year's conflict in Kosovo. Albania has become an open and safe country for foreign investment. The policies of the Albanian Government to privatize strategic sectors and absorb foreign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of security and public order, as well as the fight against organized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that are appreciated not only within my country, but elsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the establishment of the office of Ombudsman have further raised the level of protection of and respect for human rights in Albania. Albania is currently on the eve of local elections, which will be of fundamental importance for the future development of the country  not because of the results so much as because of the way in which the elections will be conducted. For this reason, the Albanian Government, in close cooperation with specialized international institutions, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Development Programme and others, has made every effort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and democratic. Albania has clearly expressed its intention to play a primary and constructive role in the common attempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and stable region, clearly aiming at European integration. The policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a requirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent expression of goodwill and mutual interest in the 8  protection of democratic institutions, fundamental freedoms, stability and prosperity in the region. Consequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded towards the creation of stable relations of mutual cooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to be a primary strategy for future European integration. Relations with these countries have been institutionalized not only bilaterally, but also multilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these relations common economic, political and security interests, as well as respect for human freedoms and rights, including those of national minorities living in the territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to make inter-Balkan relations follow the model of existing relations among European Union member countries, with the free movement of people, goods and capital. More than a year after the bloody conflict in Kosovo that endangered peace and stability in the region, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that the situation in Kosovo has improved significantly since the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the United Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by the war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the economy and of the common administration institutions has begun and the political situation and order in the country have improved significantly. The current situation in Kosovo contradicts the sceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and there, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against the establishment of the United Nations administration there. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a year ago will not fade, but will make us more conscious of the catastrophic consequences that the chauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to an innocent civilian population. In order to make a contribution to the founding of a democratic society in Kosovo in which human and national rights are fully respected, we have established very close relations with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their representatives. Albanians, even more than other people in the region, wish for and will welcome the democratization of Serbia, because, historically, they have suffered more than others from Serbian nationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up with reality, and we have to be realistic. Following very attentively the preparations for local elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government expresses its conviction that the political forces in Kosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in accordance with democratic principles and values, without acts of political violence. We would also like to express our sincere will for the full participation of the Serb community and of the other minorities in Kosovo in this electoral process because, as we have previously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and multicultural Kosovo. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the entire international community to apply stronger pressure against the Milosević regime in order to force him to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners and hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help bring the criminals who caused the massacres against the Kosovar population before the United Nations Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to strengthen the international police presence and to work on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect any kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it. I would also like to reiterate that the realization of United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the promises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar economy is of special importance. It should be included in regional cooperation projects, especially in the framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Although the Balkan political scenery has changed, and the countries of the region are engaged in a process of cooperation, there still exists a source of tension and conflict in the region, a source that has consequences for the countries of the region and beyond. It is Milosević's regime. He was not satisfied by the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he personally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is destroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining Yugoslavia. Next week, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Serbia. The current situation there indicates that very little chance exists for them to be free and fair. The recent amendments to the Yugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the opposition and the student movement and the 9  censorship and closing down of independent media are explicit facts proving that Milosević may transform these elections into a tool for illegally maintaining power. Like all the rest of the international community, the Albanian Government looks forward to genuine democratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces that possess new visions for the future of their country and of the whole region. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for the positive developments in Kosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to stabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic institutions there. As a neighbouring country, Albania closely follows developments in Montenegro. It condemns Milosević's attempts to destabilize that Republic and to undermine the democratic and integrative processes that are being undertaken by the legitimate Montenegrin leadership. Following the good- neighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the Albanian Government has recently developed intensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current relations have reached the highest level ever known, having been extended to areas of mutual interest, such as political, economic and trade cooperation, the free movement of people and so forth. It is our intention to further extend and strengthen these relations in the future. The countries in our region are involved in an already irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration. Not only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now aware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe, of the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is not integrated into the European Union. The regional conflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to understand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not only in the interest of its countries, but also in the interest of the European Union itself. An economically developed and democratically consolidated Balkans cannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The European integration of the Balkans and its development consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no importance whether a country tries to protect its democratic institutions, laws, public order or respect human rights; it can never attain the desired success if it is not economically developed. We are conscious that European integration is not an easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and difficult path. Before being integrated into the European Union, all the countries of our region should first be integrated among themselves, and existing societies in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect the best features of European civilization. In order to achieve this, we should first combat and overcome extreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and policies, because Europeanization means cooperation, tolerance and integration. The end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a turning point for the future of the Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best response to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like the European Union member countries, consider this initiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration of South-Eastern Europe into the European structures. The Albanian Government regards the implementation of the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities. Albania is highly appreciated by its international partners for the engagement and the responsibility it has shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the Stability Pact projects. We hope that the strong political will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end of the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by the will to finalize financial support for the rapid implementation of the Stability Pact projects. Albania's achievements in its domestic and foreign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its further integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The Albanian people have a clear European orientation, and that is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10 years have enjoyed their total support for their European integration policy. The present Albanian Government, representing and expressing the will of the people, has continuously fulfilled all the required conditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a higher level of relations with the European Union. We hope that in the near future the institutions of the European Union will approve the status report that the Albanian Government presented at Brussels several months ago. This approval will pave the way for the beginning of negotiations to reach Albania's association and stability agreement with the European Union. Albania's acceptance in the World Trade Organization in July this year was also an encouraging and very optimistic event in this respect. 10  The Albanian Government has welcomed the initiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of the European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in November this year. It is another affirmation of common efforts to further advance the democratization and integration processes in the region and the consolidation of security and stability there. The new century has started. We should keep on facing old problems, along with our new challenges. Some of those may be local crises, organized crime, traffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so forth, all of which require practical and well-oriented cooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of the world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia and so forth, made the role of such organizations as the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the other hand, the world has entered the era of globalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is unavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring negative consequences, especially to small and poor countries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is necessary to compile and to implement global strategies, and the United Nations can easily do that. Only a week has passed since one of the most distinguished events for the international community, the Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all the leaders of the world, where they affirmed their goodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the new millennium and in strengthening the United Nations. The Albanian Government hails the results of the Summit and expresses its conviction that all United Nations Member countries should unite all their forces for the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the final Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report: We must do more than talk about our future, however. We must start to create it. (A/54/2000, para. 17) It is time to take concrete steps in this direction.

(WEOG) rotation scheme, a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations at the beginning of 2001, for a period of three years. This is a great responsibility and a particular challenge for a small country that has only been a Member of the United Nations since 1993. My Minister of External Relations, Mr. Albert Pintat, would have loved to have been here today to express to Members Andorra's commitment to the goals of the United Nations and specially our obligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised the Brahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeeping operations, which my country supports. When he learned that he would be unable to lead this year's delegation to the United Nations, owing to unavoidable official functions in Europe, he asked me, in the light of our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC, to contribute to this general debate of the year 2000 with some free reflections — if possible innovative ones — on what globalization might mean for a small State. This is a daunting task since everything seems to have been said about the subject, but I shall try to dutifully carry out my Minister's instructions. First, however, let me convey to President Harri Holkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his election as President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, while thanking his predecessor, Theo-Ben Gurirab, for a difficult job well done. When I was a student here in the United States many years ago, I took a course in photography. I had taken from my family's house in Andorra a negative — it was one of the older glass negatives — and there in the university photography lab I set it up for developing. I remember that moment when I peered into the developer tray and saw, slowly forming on the white photographic paper, an image, the image of my great grandmother. It was a shock, there in New Haven, to see this face from a long distant past, from long before I was born, come slowly into clarity. A lost image from a lost past. If I had the time, and Members the inclination, I could tell them about my great-grandmother, a formidable woman who never left the Valley of Andorra, high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. I could tell them what her face, strong and hard as the stone of the mountains, says about the history of my country. In the photograph, she is dressed all in black, and looks away from the camera, down at the rocky ground. Behind her, one can see the stones of the 16  family farm, high up in the mountains above Saint Julia, one of the seven parishes that make up the Principality of Andorra. Her Andorra is very different from the country today. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone- strewn fields are now covered with shops, houses and hotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that are the pride of my country, churches that date back to the foundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth century and that loomed over the villages for almost a millennium, are now hemmed in by concrete buildings — stores, apartments, houses, the same buildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Beijing or New York. Yes, so much has changed since my grandfather's hand snapped this picture. My great-grandmother would recognize only the church towers and the stones of the mountains. And what was so specific about her world — the stories, the cooking, the fabric of daily life — well, that has disappeared. In the space of 70 years, Andorra has changed from being a poor and remote place to a prosperous country, with over 10 million tourists a year, who come for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. We are now a commercial hub. If you look for a country transformed by globalization, you might look to Andorra. Andorra is a country that has survived, independent and uninvaded, since 1278. It is one of the oldest and one of the smallest democracies in the world. A historian might argue that this remarkable fact is due to its isolation and poverty, or because for centuries the outside world was neatly balanced by its co-Princes — the Bishop of Urgell to the south, and to the north the Count of Foix, later the French King and since 1805 the head of the French State. Unsurprisingly, I might attribute the remarkable record of peace to the cautious character of the Andorran people. Or rather — and less partially — I think that because it is a small country, where parishes have been able to readily communicate with one another at the Casa de la Vall, the House of the Valleys, communication never broke down. The Millennium Summit of the United Nations had as its theme globalization. As a summit, it was aptly named, since I would say that globalization is the story of the second millennium — indeed perhaps it is the story of human culture. I am a politician, not a historian, but we all know the effect on both Europe and the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, or the transformation of indigenous and European cultures brought about by the “discovery” of the New World, or the effect of the slave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on both Africa and the Americas. These violent encounters formed the world even as they brought death and destruction. They also sparked our imaginations. The Globe was the name of Shakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London, a joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like to think of the United Nations as the new Globe, a theatre in which we are the players or — if we have the imagination — the dramatists for the story of our fragile planet. But the globalization we are now facing is of a different nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in his opening introduction to the Millennium conference, the starting point for this millennium can be summed up in one word: “globalization” — the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village. It is an idyllic view, the view of the world as a village. Of course, the Secretary-General is all too aware of the negative effects of the process. In the same introduction, he cautions: “Globalization offers great opportunities, but at present its benefits are very unevenly distributed while its costs are borne by all. “Thus the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people.” (A/54/2000, paras. 13 and 14) We all know the protests that have taken place, and will take place, against this same word, “globalization”. Let us listen, for instance, to one of the interested groups, chosen at random, the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), which understands the term as referring to a “globalized economic system dominated by supranational corporate trade and banking institutions that are not accountable to democratic processes or national Governments”. The IFG accuses “the GATT, WTO, Maastricht, NAFTA, combined with structural adjustment policies of the IMF and the World Bank, to be direct stimulants to the 17  processes that weaken democracy, create a world order that is under the control of transnational corporations, and that devastate the natural world”. According to the IFG, globalization brings the diminishment of powers of local and indigenous communities, States and even nations, destroys both small-scale agriculture and the earth's remaining wilderness, and brings a worldwide homogenization of diverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter its effects, the IFG advocates the revitalization of local communities by promoting maximum self-reliance, the recognition of rights of indigenous peoples and the abandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economic growth. When I listen to these words, I cannot help but hear a lament, a lament for a lost and simpler world: the world of my great-grandmother. And I am reminded of that greatest of all laments for lost culture, the work that indeed informs the thinking behind the activists who struggle against the forces of globalization — Claude Lévi-Strauss and his masterpiece, Tristes Tropiques, his elegy for the people of the Amazon basin, which even as he captured it on paper was disappearing into our modern world. I understand the sadness for the lost world, the world of the past that is always slipping away from us, that exists in the black-and-white negative of our memory. And so here I elegize, before this Assembly, all that has disappeared, not simply in Andorra but in the world, all that has been forgotten, paved over by the forces of travel, of tourism, of telephone, television, cinema and the Internet. These technologies link the world; they narrow its distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of the globe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listeners now: what new discoveries await us? We cannot imagine them, but they will come, and sooner than we think, in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours. And yet, and yet ... The IFG manifesto was not posted on a church door in Wittenburg, printed in a new technology that sparked another revolution, the Reformation of the sixteenth century. No, it was downloaded from a web site on the Internet. This Web — in which ideas, images, voices travel across our globe in a flash — is a remarkable invention that collapses both time and space. In the same way, I now realize that my image of my great-grandmother came from a negative, from a camera — a technology that perhaps more than any other, besides the computer, has transformed and quickened the pace of our world. This is to make a very simple point: not simply that this manifesto is presented in the very technology of globalization, but that nostalgia for a local economy might be a product of globalization itself. My great-grandmother had a good life, but a hard one, with terrible cold in the winter and constant work. Would she have chosen this life, if she could have had another? If she had known another? And more to the point, would she have been allowed to choose? We need to remember that people themselves have embraced change. Real people who are not content to live — physically or imaginatively — in their places of birth, but, filled with a desire to better their lives or to see the world, they reach out and try to grasp change, if only to know what they have lost. Lévi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognize that people he observed, deep in the Amazon rain forests, might want to leave their paradise — not because they were driven out by modernity, the modernity that Lévi-Strauss himself made so much of, but because they wanted to better their lives, to embrace the world, to feel for themselves the painful pulse of gain and loss. We need only leave this Hall and walk through any street in the city to recognize this. People from all across the world, people of all races, walking up and down, alone or in conversation, happy or unhappy, homesick or embracing the dreams this city seems to proffer. In the streets, we see restaurants that offer wonderful meals from all around the world, and fusion restaurants: French-Senegalese, American-Thai. Or fusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris or Hong Kong or Andorra la Vella, the people are changing, colours are shifting. What brave new world is being born around us? In saying this, I do not want to contradict the concerns of the anti-globalists, to in any way deny their recognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at our peril practical questions that turn around international finance, international corporations, the widening gulf between have and have-not countries, the dangers to the environment. 18  These are practical matters to be seen to. To paraphrase Annan, we need mechanisms to equalize the benefits of globalization, to make life a positive thing for all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest for superfluous material goods, but shelter and health and protection from disease. And I would add, simply, that before and during my tenure here as Ambassador, the United Nations hosted a series of summits or conferences designed to address these very problems — Rio, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Beijing, Rome, just to name a few. The world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the world summit for children and Rio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body of work in place to address the stresses of globalization. What we need to do now is continue to work towards our goals. In conclusion, I would like to consider a presupposition of both global optimists and pessimists: the notion that globalization has replaced nationalism. Again, to quote Kofi Annan, globalization means “the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village”. Similarly, the report published in The New York Times concerning the protests against globalization stated that “speakers do not oppose globalization per se, because, in their view, the era of nation-States is coming to its inevitable end”. Are globalization and nationalism opposed? On the surface, they would appear to be. So much of globalization — economies that transcend borders, communication networks that shrink the world — seems to render an earlier model of the nation-State obsolete. And yet, whether it be the ethnic conflicts in Rwanda or in the Balkans, issues of immigration in the developed world or conflict in East Timor, we know that the question of the border, of the passport, remains increasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness, nationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of a nationalism no longer linked to true patriotism, that is to the love of a place. I pray that the world does not succumb to an unthinking nationalism that would exist simply to exclude or to feed the ambitions of unscrupulous politicians. We need a democratic nationalism forged out of a concern for the rights of individuals. That is not nationalism as it worked out from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries — a nationalism linked to the struggle to control markets, to the scramble for loot — but a new nationalism that is not predicated on identity, on cultural sameness, a nationalism that is linked to a world economy that is no longer restricted by national borders, a democratic or civic nationalism, a global nationalism. This would be a new nationalism, I must add, in which Andorra and other small countries are not historical anachronisms, but are emblematic of this civic nationalism, predicated as it must be on the democratic will of the people. In this sense, Andorra's quiet patriotism, its 700 years of peace and communication, can modestly serve as a kind of historical model. Countries need to rethink what it means to be a nation in order to participate effectively in the life of this our globe, in order to become what we must be and to a certain extent already are: united nations. In its very name, in its very mission, the United Nations anticipated the globalization that is so rapidly occurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war and later by nuclear war, forged from the most terrible of national struggles, the United Nations is an activist forum for issues that are global, not in the sense that they transcend any individual nation, but in the sense that they are of concern to all nations. The International Criminal Court, whose statute will soon be ratified by Andorra, a country which had the honour of contributing to it by composing the first paragraphs of the preamble, is a good example of an entity that respects borders but that places human rights above all. Crimes against humanity must be punished, and shall be. This new nationalism, while it recognizes borders, asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty and peace are primary. Hence, the United Nations, even as it respects national borders, needs to recognize that it can and should become proactive in the protection of those rights in the case of civil conflict. So too, the great global threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases demands a response from each nation and a recognition that these threats can never be adequately dealt with alone, but only by working globally through the United Nations. In short, we need not only the United Nations, but, as many have said, we need united nations. 19  I began this speech with the image of my great- grandmother looking down at the stony ground of her country. I would end it, symbolically at least, with another image: our image. Someday, our great- grandchildren may discover our image, perhaps even our image here in this place. Perhaps they will reproduce it through a technology so strange, so remarkable, we cannot even imagine it. But let us hope that they live in the brave new world I have spoken of today. And let us hope that they see us as an image of positive change. We who have lived through such change cannot turn away from it. With our feet on the ground of this great globe of ours, we need to look forward. We need to grasp change. We need to reach out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n\t<tr><td>2000</td><td>55</td><td>ARE</td><td>I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere congratulations and regards on your election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of this session's proceedings. We also thank your predecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which 16  he directed the work of the previous session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for the efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. The convening of the Millennium Summit a few days ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment of the political will of the leaders of the world to deal effectively with the problems and challenges that face the international community, such as the proliferation of proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing poverty and debt, as well as other attendant transnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime, international terrorism, environmental pollution, persistent violations of human rights and the disparities resulting from globalization and information technology. The consequences of these prevailing conditions have, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness of the importance of adhering to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of consolidating the rule of international law through the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the principle of equality and the right to self- determination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of cooperation and tolerance among the different cultures, beliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for achieving the desired security, stability and human development. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome of the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Yemen, as an important political and historic event that will promote confidence-building measures and good neighbourly relations. At the same time, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow the example of those fraternal States and to respond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either entering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran's occupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice. In this context, we would like to reaffirm that all actions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic Republic of Iran on those three islands and its continued construction of military and civilian installations on them, are illegal measures considered null and void, and do not establish or entail any legal rights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In fact, they represent a violation of the territorial sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and contravene the principles and purposes of the Charters of both the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian peaceful intentions in the region. More than a year has elapsed since the Gulf Cooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial Committee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, with developing a mechanism for direct negotiations between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of the endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the reinforcement of the foundations of peace and security in the Arab Gulf region. Despite the fact that almost ten years have elapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab Gulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of that War. Consequently, it is imperative that political and diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a peaceful solution that would lead to ending the human suffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we invite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely fulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to the release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of war or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti property, in implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard, we would like to underline the importance of respecting the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as refraining from the threat or use of force, in order to ensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the region. The Middle East peace process recently witnessed important developments during which major efforts were exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable and fair solutions based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible and constructive proposals put forward by the Palestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the Israeli Government persisted in its positions of procrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to 17  abide by the agreements it had concluded with the Palestinian side. Thus, in affirming our position of solidarity with the fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership, represented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our call to the co-sponsors of the peace process — in particular the United States of America — and the other active States to continue exerting political and diplomatic efforts that support and promote negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, with the aim of finding a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this settlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al- Sharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Also in this context we reaffirm our unceasing support of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to regain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967. We call on the international community to demand that Israel resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the interest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all the States and peoples of the region. The United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once again fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory, expresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete the extension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil. In the same vein, we support the demands of sisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on it be lifted, particularly since it has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions. We also express our satisfaction at the outcome of the recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti and invite all Somali factions to reinforce national unity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and sustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the region of the Horn of Africa. The growing number of problems resulting from the continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing in some parts of the African continent, the Balkans, South Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of constant concern for the international community. Consequently, we support all regional and international efforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful means, and we emphasize that just and lasting resolution of these issues cannot be attained until the parties concerned demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate their commitment to implement relevant Security Council resolutions. Despite international unanimity, shown in the Disarmament Conference and other international forums, regarding the need to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a matter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned at this time as some States are striving to outdo each other in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in particular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a means of settling their territorial disputes. Since such actions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic security balance, at both the regional and international levels, we call upon the States concerned to review their policies in this respect and to promote the establishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean. We also urge the international community to demand once again that the Israeli Government accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and agree to subject its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Despite the multidimensional changes that the world economy is witnessing as a result of the deregulation of markets, globalization and modern technology, the economic and social gap between the developed and developing States still exists and is growing — thereby exacerbating poverty and unemployment, environmental degradation and debt accumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium Summit and the Summit's Declaration highlight the great importance our countries attach to these issues. This makes it incumbent on all of us to work assiduously on carrying out the commitments and undertakings contained therein regarding the creation of an environment favourable to development, elimination of poverty and free access for the exports of the least developed countries to the markets of industrialized countries. I confirm the determination of the United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to 18  work towards narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. The United Arab Emirates continues its sustained efforts in support of economic- and social-development projects in many countries of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, be it through direct participation in financing such projects or by supporting international and regional efforts to attain those goals. Finally, the ever-increasing burden of economic, social and human development, which is the first safeguard of the political stability that we desire, demands that mechanisms for regional and international cooperation, foremost among which is the United Nations, be created. Hence, we call for continued efforts to carry out the structural reform and development of the world Organization, in particular the Security Council and the General Assembly, so that the Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes in international relations.

                              </td></tr>\n\t<tr><td>2000</td><td>55</td><td>ARG</td><td>In this, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to emphasize the great friendship that unites the Argentine Republic and Finland. I also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to Argentina, for the constructive way in which he presided over the Assembly's work at the last session. We also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon its entry into the United Nations and extend our friendship and cooperation to its people. This debate is taking place after a very productive exchange of opinions at the highest level during the Millennium Summit, which we hope will mark, together with the final Declaration, the beginning of a new era leading to a more equitable world and a more effective Organization, in accordance with objectives set out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled “We the peoples”. For my country, this is also an opportunity to set out before the General Assembly the principles and objectives of our foreign policy. The Government of President Fernando de la Rúa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has drafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it received from the Argentine people. This policy aims at strengthening our integration with neighbouring countries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and promoting economic development, social progress, free trade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction. Argentina is determined to participate on the international scene jointly to build a peaceful and stable world based on the values of representative democracy, the rule of law, the protection and promotion of human rights, respect for the environment, economic liberalization, social progress, international cooperation and the maintenance of international peace and security, pursuant to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was stated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are shared by the vast majority of Members of this Organization. On the basis of its ongoing interests, the Government has set as a priority objective its political and economic integration with the other States members of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) — Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have agreed with these countries to consolidate MERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to promote greater integration on the basis of balance and equity. We have made significant progress towards the expansion of our markets since the signing of the Treaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of the determination of the member countries to implement an open trade policy in their economic programmes. 25  The creation of MERCOSUR was a political decision transcending the economic sphere. MERCOSUR provides a political forum within which trust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in all areas foster the increasing complementarity and convergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have bound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate members in the context of the Free Trade Area and we trust that they will become full members in the near future. As a consequence of the broadening political and economic dimensions of our integration project, we are also witnessing the convergence of approaches to defence and security in our region. This contributes to a continental perspective based on confidence and cooperation. We and our neighbours have made progress towards the creation of the joint MERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace. Argentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America reflecting the peaceful and cooperative security necessary to harmonious development. At the same time, as a member of the Rio Group, which has now grown to include Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its high-level political consultations and cooperation in order to maintain peace, strengthen representative democracy and promote sustainable development in the region. It is our firm intention that our countries shall enjoy greater participation in the global economy. At the recent summit convened in Brasilia to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American countries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and harmony that marks its relations on the basis of these principles and objectives. The consolidation of democratic stability in Latin America continues to be a central policy of the Argentine Government. We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of others and we respect international law. We promote the consolidation of democratic processes on the basis of our deep conviction that free, regular and transparent elections and a plurality of political parties are essential instruments for affirming and guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy. My country also reaffirms its commitment to eradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and to ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region. We shall continue to pursue our joint action in the regional and global campaign against drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and organized crime. The Argentine Republic has a natural interest in the South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin American countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting held in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action was adopted to implement our shared objectives in the peaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation, development, the conservation of fishery resources, the fight against drug trafficking and the protection of the environment. My country is in favour of free trade in order to achieve development and the eradication of poverty. The Argentine Government believes that protectionism not only generates the deflection of trade and the closure of markets, but also constitutes a form of discrimination. Argentina urges the entire international community to commit itself seriously to eliminating distortions of trade and will continue to fight for these objectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is being made in negotiations on the free trade agreement of the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area by the year 2005. In the World Trade Organization, our country has provided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new round to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in agriculture. Argentina also continues to support negotiations to develop political and economic association between MERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in this framework, the gradual liberalization of agricultural trade and services. We are constantly seeking new ways to integrate ourselves with the world. The realities of technological change and continual innovation require developing countries to adapt to a scheme of international economic integration based on a new paradigm of production. The challenge is to ensure the access of the least developed countries to this process of constant technological change and innovation. There can be no doubt that the international community — in particular the United Nations — must cooperate to promote the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that 26  technological innovations reach those countries with fewer resources. In his report “We the peoples”, the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this task. Without the adequate dissemination of and access to the new technologies of the digital revolution, we will see the gap between rich and poor widen. Individual States and the international community as a whole must therefore find solutions that guarantee greater fairness in the use of digital information. Argentina remains fully committed to the international community's efforts to protect the environment from the negative impact of human activities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to the principles of sustainable development agreed upon in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development — principles that were reflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment and in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the importance of making adequate preparation — during this very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for the conference to be held in 2002 to review the implementation of Agenda 21. Moreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate the international legal regimes in the field of environmental protection. In this context, and bearing in mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric warming on the global ecosystem and on human life, we attach special importance to the entry into force, as soon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The twenty-first century was preceded by a prolonged strategic and ideological confrontation, which has given way to a moment in history in which representative democracy, human rights and open economies are shared values. At the same time, we are facing a more complex world that has yet to engender a stable international order. The explosion of serious intra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkans or in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a new stage in conflicts — a stage in which, regrettably, conflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious differences. The Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute to achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing and neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the development of nations. We believe that if this consensus were based on greater democratization in international relations this would increase the efficacy and the functioning of the international system. Since it is impossible for individual States to face these threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative security policies to eliminate the potential risk of conflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of legal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united fashion the immediate and underlying causes of conflicts, which often arise because of the lack of economic opportunities and because of social inequalities. The Members of the United Nations face the challenge of finding a response to questions raised by recent international crises, including the international humanitarian crises. My country believes that the principle of non-intervention must be duly respected because it is the pillar underpinning relations between independent States. At the same time, we cannot conceal our concern at the explosion of violence against ethnic, racial or religious minorities. In particular we are concerned about the situation of vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally displaced persons, and about the situation of children in armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the international community cannot remain indifferent and must provide an adequate response to humanitarian crises. We must emphasize the role that can be played by international tribunals to create awareness that impunity will not be tolerated. The International Criminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been created, constitute important instruments of deterrence. In addition to the internal reforms that the Secretary-General has initiated with singular success within his sphere of competence, the United Nations must give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main and subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be done in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and effectively with which solutions are found to the daily problems facing the Organization. Maintenance of international peace and security is a primary responsibility of the Security Council, which must be strengthened. If these responsibilities are not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United 27  Nations can be carried out with any certainty of success. Since the inception of multilateral diplomacy, Argentina has defended the principle of the sovereign equality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our country maintains that the reform of the Security Council must be arrived at via consensus, and this consensus must not entail new discrimination, privileges or exclusions. The vast majority of the international community — seeking to ensure respect for the values of democracy and universality — believes that a new Security Council will have to allow for greater participation by all. This cannot be achieved if new permanent seats — like those established in 1945 — are established. Reform of the Council must allow all States a greater opportunity to participate in the Council, which must not be monopolized by only a few countries. For this reason, Argentina supports exclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictions on the right of the veto, without losing sight of the ultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We support the adoption of rules of procedure that guarantee transparency and the possibility of the participation of all Member States in this organ. Our support for the peaceful settlement of disputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our foreign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated the Argentine commitment to continue participating in peacekeeping operations established by the Security Council. The most recent conflicts have shown how important efficient training of the forces participating in these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina in 42 years of participating in these missions is reflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre for training for peacekeeping operations. It has been operating since 1995, with the participation of personnel from other Member States. We also established the centre for training of security forces for foreign missions. Argentina, which is currently involved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the disposal of the United Nations its military and police training centres. We also support the initiatives to strengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the Organization, and we would support restructuring efforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support for peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and in the field. My country was pleased to receive the conclusions and recommendations recently issued by the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and contained in the Brahimi report. These provide a valuable basis for building international consensus aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization to prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish peace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the Special Committee for Peacekeeping Operations, supports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a detailed analysis of the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report — including its possible financial implications — with a view to achieving its early implementation. My Government is particularly concerned about the problems related to the security and protection of those who participate in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions. The personnel of the United Nations and associated personnel, as well as the personnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian assistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as we have seen recently in the tragic events that have occurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina, which is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged an improvement in the security situation of United Nations personnel via the adoption of practical and legal measures, including financial-planning and implementation measures for these operations. In this context we should also reiterate the duty of the international community to provide assistance to those countries facing emergency situations, which arise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed conflicts. In this area a significant role can be played by the “White Helmets” initiative, which involves the establishment of bodies of specialized volunteers organized by the Members of the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are victims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the serious problems that affect these people. We should also mention the issue of AIDS which particularly affects the poorest areas of the world. More than 34 million people suffer from this illness today. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular, more than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan Africa. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The illness and death of so many workers is draining already weakened economies. The impact of this phenomenon on the future of the affected regions will 28  probably mean greater marginalization and will undermine the foundations of stability, security and peace. The international community and this Organization and its specialized agencies must contribute urgently all available resources to the fight against this disease. I would like to refer in particular to the sovereignty dispute between my country and the United Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the surrounding seas. The recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty over this part of our national territory, respecting the interests of the inhabitants and international law, is a precept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina. This item is on the agenda of the Organization, which in numerous resolutions has requested the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to renew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution to the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833. Today, in accordance with that request, Argentina reiterates once again its complete willingness to renew bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to resolve this question. We reiterate our support for the mission of good offices with which the General Assembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the parties in achieving this objective. The world stage in the post-cold-war era is the scene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal traffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we are seeing the unprecedented spread of representative democracy and economic and technological modernization. Against this backdrop, our main task is to reach agreements that will enable us to face these challenges and seize these opportunities in the best way possible. Equipping the United Nations for the challenges of the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All Member States must undertake to fulfil this commitment if our efforts are to be crowned with success. Argentina is committed to this task and will continue making its contribution. On 31 December next, my country will end its term as a member of the Security Council. During its two-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to contribute constructively to decision-making and consensus-building on all items on the Council's agenda. On the basis of our potential and bearing in mind the features of the current international situation, Argentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to continue to play an active part in the consolidation of peace and international security and in the development of peoples.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","text/markdown":"\nA tibble: 6 × 4\n\n| year &lt;dbl&gt; | session &lt;dbl&gt; | country &lt;chr&gt; | speech &lt;chr&gt; |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2000 | 55 | AFG | On my way to the Assembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State Council of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a self-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani military personnel — army, plain-clothes personnel and armed Taliban — are reported to have been positioned in the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border town of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound for an attack on Badakhshan province. On behalf of my delegation, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the major task of presiding over the important millennium session of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on his excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, which set the stage for the Millennium Summit. Three years ago, I stood before the Assembly and stated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in Afghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and answer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the dark and ominous movement known as the Taliban, which, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded Afghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the General Assembly indeed has to answer major questions. One among many is the silence the world has chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their Pakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism, which has led to the abject misery of the Afghan nation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region and beyond, is it not high time that the international community put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban processing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and inadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this view that I should like to focus my statement entirely on the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating regional and international implications, within the given time limit. 4 A question arises: what has been the result of the Talibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In an age of information and globalization, it has been a reign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in the name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms and civil liberties, massive violations of human rights, degrading and tormenting treatment of men and women, trafficking of women and girls, the forced separation of women from their menfolk, the random and deliberate round-up of individuals based on their ethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorchedearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of farmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the contamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch of children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of all but rudimentary religious education — for male students only — with the closure of all schools for females, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the situation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of the historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in order to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry and historical identity. The objective of the Pakistani military intelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to create instability in Central and South Asia by means of terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has instituted Mullah Omar, the militia's leader, as the undisputed Amir-ul-Mo'mineen, meaning “Commander of the faithful” not only in Afghanistan, but in theory throughout the Muslim world. The process the Pakistani military intelligence has chosen for the realization of its objective is to transform the Afghan nation into an exhausted, devastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation struggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to turn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit activities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other crimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing centres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act as the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan continues to carry out these activities under the name of Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment that such activities have led to the defamation of both the noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims throughout the world. In short, the Afghan nation has become the direct victim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani military's hegemonic interests in the region. These diabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military intelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution, while the implied risk and perilous consequences for the very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are overlooked. As the world is gradually awakening to the creeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that some “civilized” nations, on certain occasions, have preferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban, an entity which has failed to meet the minimum standard of being considered civilized, while having championed terrorism, human rights violations and crimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only Pakistan's military junta has continuously given its full blessing to the movement. At least until early May of this year, the official position of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and officials strangely claimed, was that it maintained contacts with both parties to the conflict. However, Pakistan's News Network International (NNI) news agency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez Musharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policy was “in accordance with Pakistan's national interest.” Advocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of Pakistan, the General was quoted as saying, “We have a national security interest, both demographic and geographic.” He further stated that in the realization of this security interest, “Pashtoons should be on our side and they”, meaning Pashtoons, “are represented by Taliban.” The world must know that in a flagrant violation of recognized international norms and principles and in clear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler of the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous pretext of national security interest, has claimed the right to impose a certain ethnic group through the invocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the cost of the sovereignty and political independence of Afghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and, prior to that, of the League of Nations, long before Pakistan was even born. It is important to remember that terrorist training camps operating from the Taliban-held territories of Afghanistan, including those established by the infamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has 5 been repeatedly called for by the United Nations and the entire international community, have been established by Pakistan's military intelligence through the Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks. They continue to utilize these territories as a ground for training, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements seeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the region and beyond. This is done under the guise of Islam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani hegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and activities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of the Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is high time that the Security Council, in accordance with relevant resolutions, undertook appropriate enforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the prime source of sponsorship of these activities. The Security Council, in its unanimously adopted resolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly demanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from sheltering, supporting and training terrorists and planning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other countries and that it extradite to the requesting States those indicted for committing international acts of terrorism. The recent upsurge of terrorist activities in Central Asian countries and beyond, emanating from the Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires drastic measures by the Security Council against the militia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration of the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the expansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999), which must include the end of terrorist activities in all forms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of Afghanistan, could adequately, among other things, serve the cause of peace and security in the region. Here I would like to welcome the proposal by the Republic of Uzbekistan for convening an international conference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the evil phenomenon of terrorism. In spite of the current devastating drought in Afghanistan — the most severe in 30 years — Afghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics. The production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by the Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan, account for considerable revenue, which is used to finance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to considerable transnational organized crime, while adding to the number of addicts, both at home and abroad. Among the many deliberate violations and instances of absolute disregard for international humanitarian law and the numerous crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban and their outside supporters in the year 2000, one could mention the following cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of 198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as hostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August of the United Nations mine-clearance employees affiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid that, according to the European Union, in the light of the devastating drought constituted a breach of international humanitarian law; the forced blood-drawing and organ removal of innocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in August; the forced deportation of the civilian populations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the closing down in August, as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from working, of all bakeries run by the United Nations World Food Programme in which widows were paid to make bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to other widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul alone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the north due to renewed Taliban military onslaughts. We believe that the commission of those heinous crimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to the lack of adequate response by the Security Council and the international community to bring to justice the perpetrators and others involved in incidents at Bamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in 1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings of Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military adviser to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998. It is significant to note that the Taliban continue to deprive women of their fundamental rights, including the right to education, which affects over 100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are still barred from employment by the Taliban. While the predictable results will speak for themselves, present 6 and future female generations of Afghanistan will be illiterate. The cultural and social impact of that criminal act on the country's future generations will be enormous. Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a fact well known to the international community. The hundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting alongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the Government; the mortal remains of hundreds of Pakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and identification cards obtained from their pockets; the intercepted radio transmissions; and the massive logistical support and the overt supply of large quantities of military hardware and ammunition, all prove the direct involvement of Pakistani army personnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General Rustam of Pakistan's armed forces, who is currently stationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, commands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations in the north. He has been assisted by two of bin Laden's henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them were involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and in the atrocities committed against the civilian population. It is important to mention that the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs magazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis having fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in excess of 80,000. A breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed contingents, including units from the North-West Frontier Corps and different commando units, have actively participated in battles on various occasions; Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the planning and command and control of both intelligence operations and logistical support; ex-commissioned officers in charge of tactical operations, artillery support and logistics; frontier militia units; paramilitary members of extremist terrorist groups affiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the Sepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and the so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or religious schools. Other categories of foreign fighters in Afghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and its affiliated units from around the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups from Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In addition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were educated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are dispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally, there are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons from around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon fodder. In this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan appeals to the Security Council to mandate the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an investigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report to the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani armed men and Arab fighters who are working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries. This would break the silence that has thus far encouraged further Pakistani intervention in Afghanistan. I should like to remind the Assembly that only those Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will be immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of Afghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment. One must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah indirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace initiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that peace has no place in the Taliban agenda. While striving for the realization of noble human values and principles — the institution of a democratic system, the observance of human rights, including those of women and girls, civil liberties and elections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates its firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for the formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully representative Government through a workable mechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or loya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the auspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as Pakistan continues to directly and massively intervene in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan considers the task of defending the territorial integrity, national unity and political independence of Afghanistan its immediate priority. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has high expectations that the United Nations and the international community will exert pressure on Pakistan to immediately cease its intervention in Afghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel and armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the Security Council will address the question of foreign 7 intervention, the existence of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; that the Organization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its view of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken and carried out in the name of Islam — which we believe distort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its tenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug Control Programme will assist the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and the international community will step up their efforts for an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan conflict; and that the international community will provide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and drought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I should like to mention that the current drought, the most severe in 30 years, will have tremendous humanitarian repercussions. We remain thankful for the statements made by the heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and in the General Assembly expressing their legitimate concerns over the dangers emanating from the Pakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan. We deeply appreciate and support the indefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no stone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries concerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. I should like to conclude by stating that the United Nations cannot embark on the new millennium without appropriately addressing the issues enshrined in its Charter, among others, the question of noninterference. Neither can this international body advocate globalization in its true sense when Talibanization is threatening regional stability in our part of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta will remain the prime actor in this dreadful and immense tragedy in Asia. Like many others afflicted with the Taliban plague, we wonder how far the evil threat of Talibanism will spread, how many more souls it will bury and how many new borders it must cross before the conscience of the international community is awakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate and drastic preventive measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 2000 | 55 | AGO | Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate, in particular, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise and dynamic manner in which he carried out his mandate. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish efforts to make the United Nations an increasingly effective instrument, capable of dealing with the demands of our times and finding and implementing solutions for the most pressing problems of the world. Just a few days ago, during the Millennium Summit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and expressed the need to adapt its structure for the demands and challenges of the future. During that event of transcendental importance for the lives of the people of this planet, the indispensable and irreplaceable character of the United Nations in international relations was reaffirmed. Member States reiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the United Nations as a privileged mechanism for international dialogue and cooperation in the name of peace and well-being of all peoples. Indeed, given the role of the United Nations as guarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is urgent that we begin the implementation of actions aimed at adapting its internal structure to new world realities. This will permit the Organization to deal rapidly and effectively with the main problems of the world and avoid having its members resort to solutions outside the established framework of its main organs  namely, the General Assembly and the Security Council. In recent years, the United Nations sought, through world summits, to find global solutions with broad international consensus for the many misfortunes that afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of the environment, violations of human rights and inadequate social development, among others. Various plans of action were outlined. However, the problems 12  they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have even become worse. A revision of the mechanism for implementing decisions is needed, through a revitalization and strengthening of the United Nations system, particularly that of its principal bodies, such as the Security Council. From our point of view, that body requires greater internal democracy, and its composition should reflect the current membership in the Organization and its geographic diversity. We think that, in this way, its decision-making would be faster and its performance in the area of peacekeeping and international security more effective. The persistence of a climate of insecurity and instability in a number of regions of the world cannot be attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems from weakness in the international security system. A reflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for example, in the early warning system and in the peacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not always corresponded to the desired objectives, either because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not sent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are not provided with adequate human, material and financial resources. Sometimes this is due to the ambiguity in the mission mandate itself. We recognize that the effectiveness of action in the area of peace and international security does not depend only on United Nations activities. There has to be renewed commitment on the part of each and every State. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent publication of the Brahimi report. It is our understanding that the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels should be made part of this commitment in order to eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In the particular case of the African continent, the continent most affected by the scourge of war, the illicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of support for wars incited by some rebel groups with the objective of overturning democratically elected regimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with the aim of reducing access of these conflict diamonds to the international market. My Government supports these initiatives and will provide any cooperation necessary for their implementation. Another serious issue affecting international security is the circulation and transfer of small arms that flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups. This takes place with the connivance of certain Governments and networks of transnational organized crime. The lack of international legal instruments capable of controlling transactions of these arms is stimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above all in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of conflicts and making their resolution even more difficult. According to United Nations data, the effects of these arms on civil populations are shocking. They have already resulted in more deaths than the two world wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict diamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes special importance for Angola. It is through the sale of illegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which they then undertook a large-scale military campaign aimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a procession of death and destruction, and it is the principal reason for the economic instability in Angola. This scenario is repeating itself in other regions of Africa and the world. For this reason, a solution is urgently required. The economic and social development and subsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for human rights, democracy and good governance can only be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and stability. It is in this context that my Government established, as a priority, the restoration of definitive peace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this objective, the general situation in Angola has significantly improved. It is for this reason that today we are more confident than ever of a future of peace, development and prosperity. Indeed, the war has ceased to have the same intensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict itself is moving progressively towards an end. The political and military measures undertaken by the Government have significantly reduced the ability of the rebels to wage war. These measures have also allowed the Government to resume control over nearly the entire country. More than 12,000 rebel military personnel have abandoned their arms and joined the efforts of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who persist in waging war have less and less space, and their activities are limited today to isolated armed attacks against civilian targets, the objective being to destroy and loot the people's property. 13  The military measures undertaken by the Government represent a necessary and legitimate recourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the rebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very existence of the Angolan democratic system. However, despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the total control of our national borders and the elimination of the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are having a positive impact in the search for peace, they do not constitute our only option for the resolution of armed conflict. Simultaneously, we will continue to implement other actions aimed at guaranteeing the total implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us continues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the Angolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our readiness to continue to integrate in our society all those who choose to abandon the option of war. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, still has an active role to play in the process of restoring peace in Angola, through the continued implementation and strengthening of sanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. The recent nomination by the Secretary-General of the members of the mechanism to monitor the application of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1295 (2000), will contribute to greater international vigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny bases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will extend their cooperation to that body. The significant improvement of the situation in Angola, however, has not brought an immediate end to the effects of war on the lives of the people. The humanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for that reason we appeal to the international community to increase its assistance to the needy populations. The positive evolution of the situation is not limited to the politico-military field; it has also carried over into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues on the path of economic reforms which have earned the confidence of international financial institutions. This progress translated to the recent signature of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund relating to the implementation of a monitored programme. We hope that the international community will contribute substantially through the investment of capital during the recovery phase of the Angolan economy in supporting stability and growth. Angola adopted legislation to protect foreign investment by providing incentives and guarantees. The international situation continues to be characterized by violence and tension in various parts of the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace and stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for stability and development in the central region of Africa. The situation in that neighbouring country, which shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common border with Angola, remains quite volatile and complex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if appropriate measures are not taken. The resolution of the Congolese conflict must come about, fundamentally, through the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In spite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new reading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to all the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Invading forces should withdraw completely from Congolese territory and cease immediately their support for the destabilization of that country. These conditions, in addition to the inter- Congolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base including the unequivocal recognition of the authority of the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the success of the peace process. Angola reiterates its commitment to continue to make the necessary efforts, together with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement, until a way out of the conflict is found. In Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities continues to delay the pacification of the country. Angola supports regional initiatives aimed at reactivating the peace process and condemns the attacks against United Nations personnel and forces. We support steps aimed at bringing to international justice the principal parties responsible for the atrocities committed against the people of that country. In Somalia, the progress reached at the national conference led to the re-establishment of some national institutions and moved the country closer to peace. 14  Angola encourages the continuation of these efforts and hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able to reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the international community. In the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive movement following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two parties honour their commitments under the accord and create conditions for the establishment of good- neighbourly relations and cooperation. Similarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding the resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through the implementation of the United Nations peace plan. Angola is following with particular attention the situation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and supports the efforts of the Government of that country to find a just and fair solution to the land problem that was inherited from the colonial period. In this context, we share and fully support the position expressed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land reform in Zimbabwe. In the Middle East, the question of Palestine constitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the region. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The resolution of this conflict must encompass a political compromise between the parties involved and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and other understandings reached. Less than a year ago, the people of East Timor finally succeeded in exercising their right to self- determination. Angola feels pleased and compensated by this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the countries that fought in the United Nations and other international forums for the right of the Timorese people to freely choose their own destiny. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, which is responsible for the management of the transition period, cannot permit the current climate of violence, provoked by the militias with the objective of impeding the independence of the territory, to impose itself over the will of a people that has already suffered for decades the scourge of colonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly condemns these acts of violence, which have resulted in great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola appeals to the Security Council to take appropriate steps to ensure its immediate cessation. In the past two years, the world economy has registered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook Asia. The industrial economies and the so-called emerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving considerable rates of growth. However, the present world economic order continues to be marked by sharp distortions between North and South. While the North enjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues to suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to these ills are restrictive economic measures imposed unilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one example  its principal victims are the most vulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to support the lifting of the embargo. The international goal of reducing by one half, by the year 2015, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts, above all by the wealthiest countries and international financial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary to relieve the burden of external debt, whose service payments alone absorb a large part of the financial resources of developing countries. At the same time, steps will be necessary to attenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite the fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community in international economic relations, globalization has benefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped countries. The structural adjustment programmes under way in many developing countries should take account of real necessities and specifics, because many of the measures imposed by the international financial institutions have caused serious difficulties, above all of a social nature. To conclude my remarks, I would like to call attention to the need to pay more attention to the economic situation of the African continent. This should be done in such a way as to facilitate its integration into the world market, particularly through the transfer of technology and increasing productive investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| 2000 | 55 | ALB | Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, and to express my strong conviction that, under your guidance, the work of this session will be conducted successfully. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the work carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and for his competent guidance of the previous session. At the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a sovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to making its modest contribution, in the activities of the community of countries Members of the United Nations, to greater peace, stability, security and economic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating internal political and economic stability, as well as by pursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving constructive cooperation with the countries of South- Eastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session, Albania has been taking further steps towards consolidating its democratic institutions and constitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its economy and consolidating and ensuring respect for human rights. Because of the efficient measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to the help provided by our partners, Albania is recovering from the consequences of last year's conflict in Kosovo. Albania has become an open and safe country for foreign investment. The policies of the Albanian Government to privatize strategic sectors and absorb foreign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of security and public order, as well as the fight against organized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that are appreciated not only within my country, but elsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the establishment of the office of Ombudsman have further raised the level of protection of and respect for human rights in Albania. Albania is currently on the eve of local elections, which will be of fundamental importance for the future development of the country  not because of the results so much as because of the way in which the elections will be conducted. For this reason, the Albanian Government, in close cooperation with specialized international institutions, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Development Programme and others, has made every effort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and democratic. Albania has clearly expressed its intention to play a primary and constructive role in the common attempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and stable region, clearly aiming at European integration. The policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a requirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent expression of goodwill and mutual interest in the 8  protection of democratic institutions, fundamental freedoms, stability and prosperity in the region. Consequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded towards the creation of stable relations of mutual cooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to be a primary strategy for future European integration. Relations with these countries have been institutionalized not only bilaterally, but also multilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these relations common economic, political and security interests, as well as respect for human freedoms and rights, including those of national minorities living in the territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to make inter-Balkan relations follow the model of existing relations among European Union member countries, with the free movement of people, goods and capital. More than a year after the bloody conflict in Kosovo that endangered peace and stability in the region, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that the situation in Kosovo has improved significantly since the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the United Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by the war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the economy and of the common administration institutions has begun and the political situation and order in the country have improved significantly. The current situation in Kosovo contradicts the sceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and there, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against the establishment of the United Nations administration there. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a year ago will not fade, but will make us more conscious of the catastrophic consequences that the chauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to an innocent civilian population. In order to make a contribution to the founding of a democratic society in Kosovo in which human and national rights are fully respected, we have established very close relations with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their representatives. Albanians, even more than other people in the region, wish for and will welcome the democratization of Serbia, because, historically, they have suffered more than others from Serbian nationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up with reality, and we have to be realistic. Following very attentively the preparations for local elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government expresses its conviction that the political forces in Kosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in accordance with democratic principles and values, without acts of political violence. We would also like to express our sincere will for the full participation of the Serb community and of the other minorities in Kosovo in this electoral process because, as we have previously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and multicultural Kosovo. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the entire international community to apply stronger pressure against the Milosević regime in order to force him to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners and hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help bring the criminals who caused the massacres against the Kosovar population before the United Nations Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to strengthen the international police presence and to work on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect any kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it. I would also like to reiterate that the realization of United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the promises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar economy is of special importance. It should be included in regional cooperation projects, especially in the framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Although the Balkan political scenery has changed, and the countries of the region are engaged in a process of cooperation, there still exists a source of tension and conflict in the region, a source that has consequences for the countries of the region and beyond. It is Milosević's regime. He was not satisfied by the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he personally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is destroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining Yugoslavia. Next week, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Serbia. The current situation there indicates that very little chance exists for them to be free and fair. The recent amendments to the Yugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the opposition and the student movement and the 9  censorship and closing down of independent media are explicit facts proving that Milosević may transform these elections into a tool for illegally maintaining power. Like all the rest of the international community, the Albanian Government looks forward to genuine democratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces that possess new visions for the future of their country and of the whole region. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for the positive developments in Kosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to stabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic institutions there. As a neighbouring country, Albania closely follows developments in Montenegro. It condemns Milosević's attempts to destabilize that Republic and to undermine the democratic and integrative processes that are being undertaken by the legitimate Montenegrin leadership. Following the good- neighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the Albanian Government has recently developed intensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current relations have reached the highest level ever known, having been extended to areas of mutual interest, such as political, economic and trade cooperation, the free movement of people and so forth. It is our intention to further extend and strengthen these relations in the future. The countries in our region are involved in an already irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration. Not only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now aware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe, of the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is not integrated into the European Union. The regional conflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to understand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not only in the interest of its countries, but also in the interest of the European Union itself. An economically developed and democratically consolidated Balkans cannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The European integration of the Balkans and its development consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no importance whether a country tries to protect its democratic institutions, laws, public order or respect human rights; it can never attain the desired success if it is not economically developed. We are conscious that European integration is not an easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and difficult path. Before being integrated into the European Union, all the countries of our region should first be integrated among themselves, and existing societies in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect the best features of European civilization. In order to achieve this, we should first combat and overcome extreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and policies, because Europeanization means cooperation, tolerance and integration. The end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a turning point for the future of the Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best response to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like the European Union member countries, consider this initiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration of South-Eastern Europe into the European structures. The Albanian Government regards the implementation of the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities. Albania is highly appreciated by its international partners for the engagement and the responsibility it has shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the Stability Pact projects. We hope that the strong political will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end of the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by the will to finalize financial support for the rapid implementation of the Stability Pact projects. Albania's achievements in its domestic and foreign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its further integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The Albanian people have a clear European orientation, and that is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10 years have enjoyed their total support for their European integration policy. The present Albanian Government, representing and expressing the will of the people, has continuously fulfilled all the required conditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a higher level of relations with the European Union. We hope that in the near future the institutions of the European Union will approve the status report that the Albanian Government presented at Brussels several months ago. This approval will pave the way for the beginning of negotiations to reach Albania's association and stability agreement with the European Union. Albania's acceptance in the World Trade Organization in July this year was also an encouraging and very optimistic event in this respect. 10  The Albanian Government has welcomed the initiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of the European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in November this year. It is another affirmation of common efforts to further advance the democratization and integration processes in the region and the consolidation of security and stability there. The new century has started. We should keep on facing old problems, along with our new challenges. Some of those may be local crises, organized crime, traffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so forth, all of which require practical and well-oriented cooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of the world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia and so forth, made the role of such organizations as the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the other hand, the world has entered the era of globalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is unavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring negative consequences, especially to small and poor countries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is necessary to compile and to implement global strategies, and the United Nations can easily do that. Only a week has passed since one of the most distinguished events for the international community, the Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all the leaders of the world, where they affirmed their goodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the new millennium and in strengthening the United Nations. The Albanian Government hails the results of the Summit and expresses its conviction that all United Nations Member countries should unite all their forces for the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the final Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report: We must do more than talk about our future, however. We must start to create it. (A/54/2000, para. 17) It is time to take concrete steps in this direction.

                                                                         |\n| 2000 | 55 | AND | Andorra will become, through the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) rotation scheme, a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations at the beginning of 2001, for a period of three years. This is a great responsibility and a particular challenge for a small country that has only been a Member of the United Nations since 1993. My Minister of External Relations, Mr. Albert Pintat, would have loved to have been here today to express to Members Andorra's commitment to the goals of the United Nations and specially our obligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised the Brahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeeping operations, which my country supports. When he learned that he would be unable to lead this year's delegation to the United Nations, owing to unavoidable official functions in Europe, he asked me, in the light of our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC, to contribute to this general debate of the year 2000 with some free reflections — if possible innovative ones — on what globalization might mean for a small State. This is a daunting task since everything seems to have been said about the subject, but I shall try to dutifully carry out my Minister's instructions. First, however, let me convey to President Harri Holkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his election as President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, while thanking his predecessor, Theo-Ben Gurirab, for a difficult job well done. When I was a student here in the United States many years ago, I took a course in photography. I had taken from my family's house in Andorra a negative — it was one of the older glass negatives — and there in the university photography lab I set it up for developing. I remember that moment when I peered into the developer tray and saw, slowly forming on the white photographic paper, an image, the image of my great grandmother. It was a shock, there in New Haven, to see this face from a long distant past, from long before I was born, come slowly into clarity. A lost image from a lost past. If I had the time, and Members the inclination, I could tell them about my great-grandmother, a formidable woman who never left the Valley of Andorra, high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. I could tell them what her face, strong and hard as the stone of the mountains, says about the history of my country. In the photograph, she is dressed all in black, and looks away from the camera, down at the rocky ground. Behind her, one can see the stones of the 16  family farm, high up in the mountains above Saint Julia, one of the seven parishes that make up the Principality of Andorra. Her Andorra is very different from the country today. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone- strewn fields are now covered with shops, houses and hotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that are the pride of my country, churches that date back to the foundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth century and that loomed over the villages for almost a millennium, are now hemmed in by concrete buildings — stores, apartments, houses, the same buildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Beijing or New York. Yes, so much has changed since my grandfather's hand snapped this picture. My great-grandmother would recognize only the church towers and the stones of the mountains. And what was so specific about her world — the stories, the cooking, the fabric of daily life — well, that has disappeared. In the space of 70 years, Andorra has changed from being a poor and remote place to a prosperous country, with over 10 million tourists a year, who come for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. We are now a commercial hub. If you look for a country transformed by globalization, you might look to Andorra. Andorra is a country that has survived, independent and uninvaded, since 1278. It is one of the oldest and one of the smallest democracies in the world. A historian might argue that this remarkable fact is due to its isolation and poverty, or because for centuries the outside world was neatly balanced by its co-Princes — the Bishop of Urgell to the south, and to the north the Count of Foix, later the French King and since 1805 the head of the French State. Unsurprisingly, I might attribute the remarkable record of peace to the cautious character of the Andorran people. Or rather — and less partially — I think that because it is a small country, where parishes have been able to readily communicate with one another at the Casa de la Vall, the House of the Valleys, communication never broke down. The Millennium Summit of the United Nations had as its theme globalization. As a summit, it was aptly named, since I would say that globalization is the story of the second millennium — indeed perhaps it is the story of human culture. I am a politician, not a historian, but we all know the effect on both Europe and the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, or the transformation of indigenous and European cultures brought about by the “discovery” of the New World, or the effect of the slave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on both Africa and the Americas. These violent encounters formed the world even as they brought death and destruction. They also sparked our imaginations. The Globe was the name of Shakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London, a joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like to think of the United Nations as the new Globe, a theatre in which we are the players or — if we have the imagination — the dramatists for the story of our fragile planet. But the globalization we are now facing is of a different nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in his opening introduction to the Millennium conference, the starting point for this millennium can be summed up in one word: “globalization” — the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village. It is an idyllic view, the view of the world as a village. Of course, the Secretary-General is all too aware of the negative effects of the process. In the same introduction, he cautions: “Globalization offers great opportunities, but at present its benefits are very unevenly distributed while its costs are borne by all. “Thus the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people.” (A/54/2000, paras. 13 and 14) We all know the protests that have taken place, and will take place, against this same word, “globalization”. Let us listen, for instance, to one of the interested groups, chosen at random, the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), which understands the term as referring to a “globalized economic system dominated by supranational corporate trade and banking institutions that are not accountable to democratic processes or national Governments”. The IFG accuses “the GATT, WTO, Maastricht, NAFTA, combined with structural adjustment policies of the IMF and the World Bank, to be direct stimulants to the 17  processes that weaken democracy, create a world order that is under the control of transnational corporations, and that devastate the natural world”. According to the IFG, globalization brings the diminishment of powers of local and indigenous communities, States and even nations, destroys both small-scale agriculture and the earth's remaining wilderness, and brings a worldwide homogenization of diverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter its effects, the IFG advocates the revitalization of local communities by promoting maximum self-reliance, the recognition of rights of indigenous peoples and the abandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economic growth. When I listen to these words, I cannot help but hear a lament, a lament for a lost and simpler world: the world of my great-grandmother. And I am reminded of that greatest of all laments for lost culture, the work that indeed informs the thinking behind the activists who struggle against the forces of globalization — Claude Lévi-Strauss and his masterpiece, Tristes Tropiques, his elegy for the people of the Amazon basin, which even as he captured it on paper was disappearing into our modern world. I understand the sadness for the lost world, the world of the past that is always slipping away from us, that exists in the black-and-white negative of our memory. And so here I elegize, before this Assembly, all that has disappeared, not simply in Andorra but in the world, all that has been forgotten, paved over by the forces of travel, of tourism, of telephone, television, cinema and the Internet. These technologies link the world; they narrow its distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of the globe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listeners now: what new discoveries await us? We cannot imagine them, but they will come, and sooner than we think, in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours. And yet, and yet ... The IFG manifesto was not posted on a church door in Wittenburg, printed in a new technology that sparked another revolution, the Reformation of the sixteenth century. No, it was downloaded from a web site on the Internet. This Web — in which ideas, images, voices travel across our globe in a flash — is a remarkable invention that collapses both time and space. In the same way, I now realize that my image of my great-grandmother came from a negative, from a camera — a technology that perhaps more than any other, besides the computer, has transformed and quickened the pace of our world. This is to make a very simple point: not simply that this manifesto is presented in the very technology of globalization, but that nostalgia for a local economy might be a product of globalization itself. My great-grandmother had a good life, but a hard one, with terrible cold in the winter and constant work. Would she have chosen this life, if she could have had another? If she had known another? And more to the point, would she have been allowed to choose? We need to remember that people themselves have embraced change. Real people who are not content to live — physically or imaginatively — in their places of birth, but, filled with a desire to better their lives or to see the world, they reach out and try to grasp change, if only to know what they have lost. Lévi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognize that people he observed, deep in the Amazon rain forests, might want to leave their paradise — not because they were driven out by modernity, the modernity that Lévi-Strauss himself made so much of, but because they wanted to better their lives, to embrace the world, to feel for themselves the painful pulse of gain and loss. We need only leave this Hall and walk through any street in the city to recognize this. People from all across the world, people of all races, walking up and down, alone or in conversation, happy or unhappy, homesick or embracing the dreams this city seems to proffer. In the streets, we see restaurants that offer wonderful meals from all around the world, and fusion restaurants: French-Senegalese, American-Thai. Or fusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris or Hong Kong or Andorra la Vella, the people are changing, colours are shifting. What brave new world is being born around us? In saying this, I do not want to contradict the concerns of the anti-globalists, to in any way deny their recognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at our peril practical questions that turn around international finance, international corporations, the widening gulf between have and have-not countries, the dangers to the environment. 18  These are practical matters to be seen to. To paraphrase Annan, we need mechanisms to equalize the benefits of globalization, to make life a positive thing for all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest for superfluous material goods, but shelter and health and protection from disease. And I would add, simply, that before and during my tenure here as Ambassador, the United Nations hosted a series of summits or conferences designed to address these very problems — Rio, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Beijing, Rome, just to name a few. The world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the world summit for children and Rio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body of work in place to address the stresses of globalization. What we need to do now is continue to work towards our goals. In conclusion, I would like to consider a presupposition of both global optimists and pessimists: the notion that globalization has replaced nationalism. Again, to quote Kofi Annan, globalization means “the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village”. Similarly, the report published in The New York Times concerning the protests against globalization stated that “speakers do not oppose globalization per se, because, in their view, the era of nation-States is coming to its inevitable end”. Are globalization and nationalism opposed? On the surface, they would appear to be. So much of globalization — economies that transcend borders, communication networks that shrink the world — seems to render an earlier model of the nation-State obsolete. And yet, whether it be the ethnic conflicts in Rwanda or in the Balkans, issues of immigration in the developed world or conflict in East Timor, we know that the question of the border, of the passport, remains increasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness, nationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of a nationalism no longer linked to true patriotism, that is to the love of a place. I pray that the world does not succumb to an unthinking nationalism that would exist simply to exclude or to feed the ambitions of unscrupulous politicians. We need a democratic nationalism forged out of a concern for the rights of individuals. That is not nationalism as it worked out from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries — a nationalism linked to the struggle to control markets, to the scramble for loot — but a new nationalism that is not predicated on identity, on cultural sameness, a nationalism that is linked to a world economy that is no longer restricted by national borders, a democratic or civic nationalism, a global nationalism. This would be a new nationalism, I must add, in which Andorra and other small countries are not historical anachronisms, but are emblematic of this civic nationalism, predicated as it must be on the democratic will of the people. In this sense, Andorra's quiet patriotism, its 700 years of peace and communication, can modestly serve as a kind of historical model. Countries need to rethink what it means to be a nation in order to participate effectively in the life of this our globe, in order to become what we must be and to a certain extent already are: united nations. In its very name, in its very mission, the United Nations anticipated the globalization that is so rapidly occurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war and later by nuclear war, forged from the most terrible of national struggles, the United Nations is an activist forum for issues that are global, not in the sense that they transcend any individual nation, but in the sense that they are of concern to all nations. The International Criminal Court, whose statute will soon be ratified by Andorra, a country which had the honour of contributing to it by composing the first paragraphs of the preamble, is a good example of an entity that respects borders but that places human rights above all. Crimes against humanity must be punished, and shall be. This new nationalism, while it recognizes borders, asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty and peace are primary. Hence, the United Nations, even as it respects national borders, needs to recognize that it can and should become proactive in the protection of those rights in the case of civil conflict. So too, the great global threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases demands a response from each nation and a recognition that these threats can never be adequately dealt with alone, but only by working globally through the United Nations. In short, we need not only the United Nations, but, as many have said, we need united nations. 19  I began this speech with the image of my great- grandmother looking down at the stony ground of her country. I would end it, symbolically at least, with another image: our image. Someday, our great- grandchildren may discover our image, perhaps even our image here in this place. Perhaps they will reproduce it through a technology so strange, so remarkable, we cannot even imagine it. But let us hope that they live in the brave new world I have spoken of today. And let us hope that they see us as an image of positive change. We who have lived through such change cannot turn away from it. With our feet on the ground of this great globe of ours, we need to look forward. We need to grasp change. We need to reach out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 2000 | 55 | ARE | I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere congratulations and regards on your election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of this session's proceedings. We also thank your predecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which 16  he directed the work of the previous session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for the efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. The convening of the Millennium Summit a few days ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment of the political will of the leaders of the world to deal effectively with the problems and challenges that face the international community, such as the proliferation of proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing poverty and debt, as well as other attendant transnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime, international terrorism, environmental pollution, persistent violations of human rights and the disparities resulting from globalization and information technology. The consequences of these prevailing conditions have, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness of the importance of adhering to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of consolidating the rule of international law through the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the principle of equality and the right to self- determination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of cooperation and tolerance among the different cultures, beliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for achieving the desired security, stability and human development. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome of the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Yemen, as an important political and historic event that will promote confidence-building measures and good neighbourly relations. At the same time, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow the example of those fraternal States and to respond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either entering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran's occupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice. In this context, we would like to reaffirm that all actions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic Republic of Iran on those three islands and its continued construction of military and civilian installations on them, are illegal measures considered null and void, and do not establish or entail any legal rights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In fact, they represent a violation of the territorial sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and contravene the principles and purposes of the Charters of both the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian peaceful intentions in the region. More than a year has elapsed since the Gulf Cooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial Committee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, with developing a mechanism for direct negotiations between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of the endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the reinforcement of the foundations of peace and security in the Arab Gulf region. Despite the fact that almost ten years have elapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab Gulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of that War. Consequently, it is imperative that political and diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a peaceful solution that would lead to ending the human suffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we invite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely fulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to the release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of war or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti property, in implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard, we would like to underline the importance of respecting the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as refraining from the threat or use of force, in order to ensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the region. The Middle East peace process recently witnessed important developments during which major efforts were exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable and fair solutions based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible and constructive proposals put forward by the Palestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the Israeli Government persisted in its positions of procrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to 17  abide by the agreements it had concluded with the Palestinian side. Thus, in affirming our position of solidarity with the fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership, represented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our call to the co-sponsors of the peace process — in particular the United States of America — and the other active States to continue exerting political and diplomatic efforts that support and promote negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, with the aim of finding a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this settlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al- Sharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Also in this context we reaffirm our unceasing support of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to regain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967. We call on the international community to demand that Israel resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the interest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all the States and peoples of the region. The United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once again fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory, expresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete the extension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil. In the same vein, we support the demands of sisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on it be lifted, particularly since it has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions. We also express our satisfaction at the outcome of the recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti and invite all Somali factions to reinforce national unity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and sustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the region of the Horn of Africa. The growing number of problems resulting from the continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing in some parts of the African continent, the Balkans, South Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of constant concern for the international community. Consequently, we support all regional and international efforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful means, and we emphasize that just and lasting resolution of these issues cannot be attained until the parties concerned demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate their commitment to implement relevant Security Council resolutions. Despite international unanimity, shown in the Disarmament Conference and other international forums, regarding the need to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a matter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned at this time as some States are striving to outdo each other in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in particular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a means of settling their territorial disputes. Since such actions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic security balance, at both the regional and international levels, we call upon the States concerned to review their policies in this respect and to promote the establishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean. We also urge the international community to demand once again that the Israeli Government accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and agree to subject its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Despite the multidimensional changes that the world economy is witnessing as a result of the deregulation of markets, globalization and modern technology, the economic and social gap between the developed and developing States still exists and is growing — thereby exacerbating poverty and unemployment, environmental degradation and debt accumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium Summit and the Summit's Declaration highlight the great importance our countries attach to these issues. This makes it incumbent on all of us to work assiduously on carrying out the commitments and undertakings contained therein regarding the creation of an environment favourable to development, elimination of poverty and free access for the exports of the least developed countries to the markets of industrialized countries. I confirm the determination of the United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to 18  work towards narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. The United Arab Emirates continues its sustained efforts in support of economic- and social-development projects in many countries of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, be it through direct participation in financing such projects or by supporting international and regional efforts to attain those goals. Finally, the ever-increasing burden of economic, social and human development, which is the first safeguard of the political stability that we desire, demands that mechanisms for regional and international cooperation, foremost among which is the United Nations, be created. Hence, we call for continued efforts to carry out the structural reform and development of the world Organization, in particular the Security Council and the General Assembly, so that the Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes in international relations.

                               |\n| 2000 | 55 | ARG | In this, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to emphasize the great friendship that unites the Argentine Republic and Finland. I also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to Argentina, for the constructive way in which he presided over the Assembly's work at the last session. We also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon its entry into the United Nations and extend our friendship and cooperation to its people. This debate is taking place after a very productive exchange of opinions at the highest level during the Millennium Summit, which we hope will mark, together with the final Declaration, the beginning of a new era leading to a more equitable world and a more effective Organization, in accordance with objectives set out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled “We the peoples”. For my country, this is also an opportunity to set out before the General Assembly the principles and objectives of our foreign policy. The Government of President Fernando de la Rúa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has drafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it received from the Argentine people. This policy aims at strengthening our integration with neighbouring countries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and promoting economic development, social progress, free trade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction. Argentina is determined to participate on the international scene jointly to build a peaceful and stable world based on the values of representative democracy, the rule of law, the protection and promotion of human rights, respect for the environment, economic liberalization, social progress, international cooperation and the maintenance of international peace and security, pursuant to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was stated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are shared by the vast majority of Members of this Organization. On the basis of its ongoing interests, the Government has set as a priority objective its political and economic integration with the other States members of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) — Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have agreed with these countries to consolidate MERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to promote greater integration on the basis of balance and equity. We have made significant progress towards the expansion of our markets since the signing of the Treaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of the determination of the member countries to implement an open trade policy in their economic programmes. 25  The creation of MERCOSUR was a political decision transcending the economic sphere. MERCOSUR provides a political forum within which trust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in all areas foster the increasing complementarity and convergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have bound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate members in the context of the Free Trade Area and we trust that they will become full members in the near future. As a consequence of the broadening political and economic dimensions of our integration project, we are also witnessing the convergence of approaches to defence and security in our region. This contributes to a continental perspective based on confidence and cooperation. We and our neighbours have made progress towards the creation of the joint MERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace. Argentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America reflecting the peaceful and cooperative security necessary to harmonious development. At the same time, as a member of the Rio Group, which has now grown to include Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its high-level political consultations and cooperation in order to maintain peace, strengthen representative democracy and promote sustainable development in the region. It is our firm intention that our countries shall enjoy greater participation in the global economy. At the recent summit convened in Brasilia to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American countries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and harmony that marks its relations on the basis of these principles and objectives. The consolidation of democratic stability in Latin America continues to be a central policy of the Argentine Government. We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of others and we respect international law. We promote the consolidation of democratic processes on the basis of our deep conviction that free, regular and transparent elections and a plurality of political parties are essential instruments for affirming and guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy. My country also reaffirms its commitment to eradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and to ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region. We shall continue to pursue our joint action in the regional and global campaign against drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and organized crime. The Argentine Republic has a natural interest in the South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin American countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting held in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action was adopted to implement our shared objectives in the peaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation, development, the conservation of fishery resources, the fight against drug trafficking and the protection of the environment. My country is in favour of free trade in order to achieve development and the eradication of poverty. The Argentine Government believes that protectionism not only generates the deflection of trade and the closure of markets, but also constitutes a form of discrimination. Argentina urges the entire international community to commit itself seriously to eliminating distortions of trade and will continue to fight for these objectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is being made in negotiations on the free trade agreement of the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area by the year 2005. In the World Trade Organization, our country has provided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new round to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in agriculture. Argentina also continues to support negotiations to develop political and economic association between MERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in this framework, the gradual liberalization of agricultural trade and services. We are constantly seeking new ways to integrate ourselves with the world. The realities of technological change and continual innovation require developing countries to adapt to a scheme of international economic integration based on a new paradigm of production. The challenge is to ensure the access of the least developed countries to this process of constant technological change and innovation. There can be no doubt that the international community — in particular the United Nations — must cooperate to promote the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that 26  technological innovations reach those countries with fewer resources. In his report “We the peoples”, the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this task. Without the adequate dissemination of and access to the new technologies of the digital revolution, we will see the gap between rich and poor widen. Individual States and the international community as a whole must therefore find solutions that guarantee greater fairness in the use of digital information. Argentina remains fully committed to the international community's efforts to protect the environment from the negative impact of human activities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to the principles of sustainable development agreed upon in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development — principles that were reflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment and in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the importance of making adequate preparation — during this very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for the conference to be held in 2002 to review the implementation of Agenda 21. Moreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate the international legal regimes in the field of environmental protection. In this context, and bearing in mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric warming on the global ecosystem and on human life, we attach special importance to the entry into force, as soon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The twenty-first century was preceded by a prolonged strategic and ideological confrontation, which has given way to a moment in history in which representative democracy, human rights and open economies are shared values. At the same time, we are facing a more complex world that has yet to engender a stable international order. The explosion of serious intra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkans or in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a new stage in conflicts — a stage in which, regrettably, conflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious differences. The Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute to achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing and neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the development of nations. We believe that if this consensus were based on greater democratization in international relations this would increase the efficacy and the functioning of the international system. Since it is impossible for individual States to face these threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative security policies to eliminate the potential risk of conflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of legal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united fashion the immediate and underlying causes of conflicts, which often arise because of the lack of economic opportunities and because of social inequalities. The Members of the United Nations face the challenge of finding a response to questions raised by recent international crises, including the international humanitarian crises. My country believes that the principle of non-intervention must be duly respected because it is the pillar underpinning relations between independent States. At the same time, we cannot conceal our concern at the explosion of violence against ethnic, racial or religious minorities. In particular we are concerned about the situation of vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally displaced persons, and about the situation of children in armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the international community cannot remain indifferent and must provide an adequate response to humanitarian crises. We must emphasize the role that can be played by international tribunals to create awareness that impunity will not be tolerated. The International Criminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been created, constitute important instruments of deterrence. In addition to the internal reforms that the Secretary-General has initiated with singular success within his sphere of competence, the United Nations must give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main and subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be done in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and effectively with which solutions are found to the daily problems facing the Organization. Maintenance of international peace and security is a primary responsibility of the Security Council, which must be strengthened. If these responsibilities are not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United 27  Nations can be carried out with any certainty of success. Since the inception of multilateral diplomacy, Argentina has defended the principle of the sovereign equality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our country maintains that the reform of the Security Council must be arrived at via consensus, and this consensus must not entail new discrimination, privileges or exclusions. The vast majority of the international community — seeking to ensure respect for the values of democracy and universality — believes that a new Security Council will have to allow for greater participation by all. This cannot be achieved if new permanent seats — like those established in 1945 — are established. Reform of the Council must allow all States a greater opportunity to participate in the Council, which must not be monopolized by only a few countries. For this reason, Argentina supports exclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictions on the right of the veto, without losing sight of the ultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We support the adoption of rules of procedure that guarantee transparency and the possibility of the participation of all Member States in this organ. Our support for the peaceful settlement of disputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our foreign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated the Argentine commitment to continue participating in peacekeeping operations established by the Security Council. The most recent conflicts have shown how important efficient training of the forces participating in these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina in 42 years of participating in these missions is reflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre for training for peacekeeping operations. It has been operating since 1995, with the participation of personnel from other Member States. We also established the centre for training of security forces for foreign missions. Argentina, which is currently involved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the disposal of the United Nations its military and police training centres. We also support the initiatives to strengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the Organization, and we would support restructuring efforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support for peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and in the field. My country was pleased to receive the conclusions and recommendations recently issued by the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and contained in the Brahimi report. These provide a valuable basis for building international consensus aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization to prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish peace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the Special Committee for Peacekeeping Operations, supports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a detailed analysis of the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report — including its possible financial implications — with a view to achieving its early implementation. My Government is particularly concerned about the problems related to the security and protection of those who participate in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions. The personnel of the United Nations and associated personnel, as well as the personnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian assistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as we have seen recently in the tragic events that have occurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina, which is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged an improvement in the security situation of United Nations personnel via the adoption of practical and legal measures, including financial-planning and implementation measures for these operations. In this context we should also reiterate the duty of the international community to provide assistance to those countries facing emergency situations, which arise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed conflicts. In this area a significant role can be played by the “White Helmets” initiative, which involves the establishment of bodies of specialized volunteers organized by the Members of the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are victims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the serious problems that affect these people. We should also mention the issue of AIDS which particularly affects the poorest areas of the world. More than 34 million people suffer from this illness today. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular, more than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan Africa. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The illness and death of so many workers is draining already weakened economies. The impact of this phenomenon on the future of the affected regions will 28  probably mean greater marginalization and will undermine the foundations of stability, security and peace. The international community and this Organization and its specialized agencies must contribute urgently all available resources to the fight against this disease. I would like to refer in particular to the sovereignty dispute between my country and the United Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the surrounding seas. The recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty over this part of our national territory, respecting the interests of the inhabitants and international law, is a precept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina. This item is on the agenda of the Organization, which in numerous resolutions has requested the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to renew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution to the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833. Today, in accordance with that request, Argentina reiterates once again its complete willingness to renew bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to resolve this question. We reiterate our support for the mission of good offices with which the General Assembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the parties in achieving this objective. The world stage in the post-cold-war era is the scene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal traffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we are seeing the unprecedented spread of representative democracy and economic and technological modernization. Against this backdrop, our main task is to reach agreements that will enable us to face these challenges and seize these opportunities in the best way possible. Equipping the United Nations for the challenges of the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All Member States must undertake to fulfil this commitment if our efforts are to be crowned with success. Argentina is committed to this task and will continue making its contribution. On 31 December next, my country will end its term as a member of the Security Council. During its two-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to contribute constructively to decision-making and consensus-building on all items on the Council's agenda. On the basis of our potential and bearing in mind the features of the current international situation, Argentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to continue to play an active part in the consolidation of peace and international security and in the development of peoples. |\n\n","text/latex":"A tibble: 6 × 4\n\\begin{tabular}{llll}\n year & session & country & speech\\\\\n <dbl> & <dbl> & <chr> & <chr>\\\\\n\\hline\n\t 2000 & 55 & AFG & On my way to the Assembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State Council of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a self-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani military personnel — army, plain-clothes personnel and armed Taliban — are reported to have been positioned in the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border town of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound for an attack on Badakhshan province. On behalf of my delegation, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the major task of presiding over the important millennium session of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on his excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, which set the stage for the Millennium Summit. Three years ago, I stood before the Assembly and stated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in Afghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and answer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the dark and ominous movement known as the Taliban, which, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded Afghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the General Assembly indeed has to answer major questions. One among many is the silence the world has chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their Pakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism, which has led to the abject misery of the Afghan nation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region and beyond, is it not high time that the international community put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban processing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and inadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this view that I should like to focus my statement entirely on the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating regional and international implications, within the given time limit. 4 A question arises: what has been the result of the Talibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In an age of information and globalization, it has been a reign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in the name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms and civil liberties, massive violations of human rights, degrading and tormenting treatment of men and women, trafficking of women and girls, the forced separation of women from their menfolk, the random and deliberate round-up of individuals based on their ethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorchedearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of farmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the contamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch of children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of all but rudimentary religious education — for male students only — with the closure of all schools for females, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the situation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of the historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in order to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry and historical identity. The objective of the Pakistani military intelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to create instability in Central and South Asia by means of terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has instituted Mullah Omar, the militia's leader, as the undisputed Amir-ul-Mo'mineen, meaning “Commander of the faithful” not only in Afghanistan, but in theory throughout the Muslim world. The process the Pakistani military intelligence has chosen for the realization of its objective is to transform the Afghan nation into an exhausted, devastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation struggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to turn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit activities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other crimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing centres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act as the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan continues to carry out these activities under the name of Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment that such activities have led to the defamation of both the noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims throughout the world. In short, the Afghan nation has become the direct victim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani military's hegemonic interests in the region. These diabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military intelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution, while the implied risk and perilous consequences for the very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are overlooked. As the world is gradually awakening to the creeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that some “civilized” nations, on certain occasions, have preferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban, an entity which has failed to meet the minimum standard of being considered civilized, while having championed terrorism, human rights violations and crimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only Pakistan's military junta has continuously given its full blessing to the movement. At least until early May of this year, the official position of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and officials strangely claimed, was that it maintained contacts with both parties to the conflict. However, Pakistan's News Network International (NNI) news agency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez Musharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policy was “in accordance with Pakistan's national interest.” Advocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of Pakistan, the General was quoted as saying, “We have a national security interest, both demographic and geographic.” He further stated that in the realization of this security interest, “Pashtoons should be on our side and they”, meaning Pashtoons, “are represented by Taliban.” The world must know that in a flagrant violation of recognized international norms and principles and in clear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler of the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous pretext of national security interest, has claimed the right to impose a certain ethnic group through the invocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the cost of the sovereignty and political independence of Afghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and, prior to that, of the League of Nations, long before Pakistan was even born. It is important to remember that terrorist training camps operating from the Taliban-held territories of Afghanistan, including those established by the infamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has 5 been repeatedly called for by the United Nations and the entire international community, have been established by Pakistan's military intelligence through the Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks. They continue to utilize these territories as a ground for training, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements seeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the region and beyond. This is done under the guise of Islam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani hegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and activities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of the Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is high time that the Security Council, in accordance with relevant resolutions, undertook appropriate enforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the prime source of sponsorship of these activities. The Security Council, in its unanimously adopted resolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly demanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from sheltering, supporting and training terrorists and planning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other countries and that it extradite to the requesting States those indicted for committing international acts of terrorism. The recent upsurge of terrorist activities in Central Asian countries and beyond, emanating from the Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires drastic measures by the Security Council against the militia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration of the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the expansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999), which must include the end of terrorist activities in all forms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of Afghanistan, could adequately, among other things, serve the cause of peace and security in the region. Here I would like to welcome the proposal by the Republic of Uzbekistan for convening an international conference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the evil phenomenon of terrorism. In spite of the current devastating drought in Afghanistan — the most severe in 30 years — Afghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics. The production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by the Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan, account for considerable revenue, which is used to finance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to considerable transnational organized crime, while adding to the number of addicts, both at home and abroad. Among the many deliberate violations and instances of absolute disregard for international humanitarian law and the numerous crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban and their outside supporters in the year 2000, one could mention the following cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of 198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as hostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August of the United Nations mine-clearance employees affiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid that, according to the European Union, in the light of the devastating drought constituted a breach of international humanitarian law; the forced blood-drawing and organ removal of innocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in August; the forced deportation of the civilian populations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the closing down in August, as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from working, of all bakeries run by the United Nations World Food Programme in which widows were paid to make bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to other widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul alone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the north due to renewed Taliban military onslaughts. We believe that the commission of those heinous crimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to the lack of adequate response by the Security Council and the international community to bring to justice the perpetrators and others involved in incidents at Bamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in 1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings of Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military adviser to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998. It is significant to note that the Taliban continue to deprive women of their fundamental rights, including the right to education, which affects over 100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are still barred from employment by the Taliban. While the predictable results will speak for themselves, present 6 and future female generations of Afghanistan will be illiterate. The cultural and social impact of that criminal act on the country's future generations will be enormous. Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a fact well known to the international community. The hundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting alongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the Government; the mortal remains of hundreds of Pakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and identification cards obtained from their pockets; the intercepted radio transmissions; and the massive logistical support and the overt supply of large quantities of military hardware and ammunition, all prove the direct involvement of Pakistani army personnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General Rustam of Pakistan's armed forces, who is currently stationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, commands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations in the north. He has been assisted by two of bin Laden's henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them were involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and in the atrocities committed against the civilian population. It is important to mention that the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs magazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis having fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in excess of 80,000. A breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed contingents, including units from the North-West Frontier Corps and different commando units, have actively participated in battles on various occasions; Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the planning and command and control of both intelligence operations and logistical support; ex-commissioned officers in charge of tactical operations, artillery support and logistics; frontier militia units; paramilitary members of extremist terrorist groups affiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the Sepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and the so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or religious schools. Other categories of foreign fighters in Afghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and its affiliated units from around the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups from Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In addition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were educated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are dispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally, there are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons from around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon fodder. In this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan appeals to the Security Council to mandate the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an investigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report to the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani armed men and Arab fighters who are working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries. This would break the silence that has thus far encouraged further Pakistani intervention in Afghanistan. I should like to remind the Assembly that only those Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will be immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of Afghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment. One must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah indirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace initiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that peace has no place in the Taliban agenda. While striving for the realization of noble human values and principles — the institution of a democratic system, the observance of human rights, including those of women and girls, civil liberties and elections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates its firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for the formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully representative Government through a workable mechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or loya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the auspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as Pakistan continues to directly and massively intervene in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan considers the task of defending the territorial integrity, national unity and political independence of Afghanistan its immediate priority. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has high expectations that the United Nations and the international community will exert pressure on Pakistan to immediately cease its intervention in Afghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel and armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the Security Council will address the question of foreign 7 intervention, the existence of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; that the Organization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its view of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken and carried out in the name of Islam — which we believe distort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its tenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug Control Programme will assist the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and the international community will step up their efforts for an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan conflict; and that the international community will provide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and drought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I should like to mention that the current drought, the most severe in 30 years, will have tremendous humanitarian repercussions. We remain thankful for the statements made by the heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and in the General Assembly expressing their legitimate concerns over the dangers emanating from the Pakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan. We deeply appreciate and support the indefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no stone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries concerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. I should like to conclude by stating that the United Nations cannot embark on the new millennium without appropriately addressing the issues enshrined in its Charter, among others, the question of noninterference. Neither can this international body advocate globalization in its true sense when Talibanization is threatening regional stability in our part of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta will remain the prime actor in this dreadful and immense tragedy in Asia. Like many others afflicted with the Taliban plague, we wonder how far the evil threat of Talibanism will spread, how many more souls it will bury and how many new borders it must cross before the conscience of the international community is awakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate and drastic preventive measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n\t 2000 & 55 & AGO & Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate, in particular, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise and dynamic manner in which he carried out his mandate. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish efforts to make the United Nations an increasingly effective instrument, capable of dealing with the demands of our times and finding and implementing solutions for the most pressing problems of the world. Just a few days ago, during the Millennium Summit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and expressed the need to adapt its structure for the demands and challenges of the future. During that event of transcendental importance for the lives of the people of this planet, the indispensable and irreplaceable character of the United Nations in international relations was reaffirmed. Member States reiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the United Nations as a privileged mechanism for international dialogue and cooperation in the name of peace and well-being of all peoples. Indeed, given the role of the United Nations as guarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is urgent that we begin the implementation of actions aimed at adapting its internal structure to new world realities. This will permit the Organization to deal rapidly and effectively with the main problems of the world and avoid having its members resort to solutions outside the established framework of its main organs  namely, the General Assembly and the Security Council. In recent years, the United Nations sought, through world summits, to find global solutions with broad international consensus for the many misfortunes that afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of the environment, violations of human rights and inadequate social development, among others. Various plans of action were outlined. However, the problems 12  they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have even become worse. A revision of the mechanism for implementing decisions is needed, through a revitalization and strengthening of the United Nations system, particularly that of its principal bodies, such as the Security Council. From our point of view, that body requires greater internal democracy, and its composition should reflect the current membership in the Organization and its geographic diversity. We think that, in this way, its decision-making would be faster and its performance in the area of peacekeeping and international security more effective. The persistence of a climate of insecurity and instability in a number of regions of the world cannot be attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems from weakness in the international security system. A reflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for example, in the early warning system and in the peacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not always corresponded to the desired objectives, either because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not sent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are not provided with adequate human, material and financial resources. Sometimes this is due to the ambiguity in the mission mandate itself. We recognize that the effectiveness of action in the area of peace and international security does not depend only on United Nations activities. There has to be renewed commitment on the part of each and every State. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent publication of the Brahimi report. It is our understanding that the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels should be made part of this commitment in order to eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In the particular case of the African continent, the continent most affected by the scourge of war, the illicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of support for wars incited by some rebel groups with the objective of overturning democratically elected regimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with the aim of reducing access of these conflict diamonds to the international market. My Government supports these initiatives and will provide any cooperation necessary for their implementation. Another serious issue affecting international security is the circulation and transfer of small arms that flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups. This takes place with the connivance of certain Governments and networks of transnational organized crime. The lack of international legal instruments capable of controlling transactions of these arms is stimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above all in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of conflicts and making their resolution even more difficult. According to United Nations data, the effects of these arms on civil populations are shocking. They have already resulted in more deaths than the two world wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict diamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes special importance for Angola. It is through the sale of illegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which they then undertook a large-scale military campaign aimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a procession of death and destruction, and it is the principal reason for the economic instability in Angola. This scenario is repeating itself in other regions of Africa and the world. For this reason, a solution is urgently required. The economic and social development and subsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for human rights, democracy and good governance can only be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and stability. It is in this context that my Government established, as a priority, the restoration of definitive peace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this objective, the general situation in Angola has significantly improved. It is for this reason that today we are more confident than ever of a future of peace, development and prosperity. Indeed, the war has ceased to have the same intensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict itself is moving progressively towards an end. The political and military measures undertaken by the Government have significantly reduced the ability of the rebels to wage war. These measures have also allowed the Government to resume control over nearly the entire country. More than 12,000 rebel military personnel have abandoned their arms and joined the efforts of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who persist in waging war have less and less space, and their activities are limited today to isolated armed attacks against civilian targets, the objective being to destroy and loot the people's property. 13  The military measures undertaken by the Government represent a necessary and legitimate recourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the rebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very existence of the Angolan democratic system. However, despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the total control of our national borders and the elimination of the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are having a positive impact in the search for peace, they do not constitute our only option for the resolution of armed conflict. Simultaneously, we will continue to implement other actions aimed at guaranteeing the total implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us continues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the Angolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our readiness to continue to integrate in our society all those who choose to abandon the option of war. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, still has an active role to play in the process of restoring peace in Angola, through the continued implementation and strengthening of sanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. The recent nomination by the Secretary-General of the members of the mechanism to monitor the application of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1295 (2000), will contribute to greater international vigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny bases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will extend their cooperation to that body. The significant improvement of the situation in Angola, however, has not brought an immediate end to the effects of war on the lives of the people. The humanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for that reason we appeal to the international community to increase its assistance to the needy populations. The positive evolution of the situation is not limited to the politico-military field; it has also carried over into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues on the path of economic reforms which have earned the confidence of international financial institutions. This progress translated to the recent signature of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund relating to the implementation of a monitored programme. We hope that the international community will contribute substantially through the investment of capital during the recovery phase of the Angolan economy in supporting stability and growth. Angola adopted legislation to protect foreign investment by providing incentives and guarantees. The international situation continues to be characterized by violence and tension in various parts of the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace and stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for stability and development in the central region of Africa. The situation in that neighbouring country, which shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common border with Angola, remains quite volatile and complex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if appropriate measures are not taken. The resolution of the Congolese conflict must come about, fundamentally, through the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In spite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new reading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to all the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Invading forces should withdraw completely from Congolese territory and cease immediately their support for the destabilization of that country. These conditions, in addition to the inter- Congolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base including the unequivocal recognition of the authority of the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the success of the peace process. Angola reiterates its commitment to continue to make the necessary efforts, together with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement, until a way out of the conflict is found. In Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities continues to delay the pacification of the country. Angola supports regional initiatives aimed at reactivating the peace process and condemns the attacks against United Nations personnel and forces. We support steps aimed at bringing to international justice the principal parties responsible for the atrocities committed against the people of that country. In Somalia, the progress reached at the national conference led to the re-establishment of some national institutions and moved the country closer to peace. 14  Angola encourages the continuation of these efforts and hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able to reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the international community. In the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive movement following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two parties honour their commitments under the accord and create conditions for the establishment of good- neighbourly relations and cooperation. Similarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding the resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through the implementation of the United Nations peace plan. Angola is following with particular attention the situation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and supports the efforts of the Government of that country to find a just and fair solution to the land problem that was inherited from the colonial period. In this context, we share and fully support the position expressed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land reform in Zimbabwe. In the Middle East, the question of Palestine constitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the region. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The resolution of this conflict must encompass a political compromise between the parties involved and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and other understandings reached. Less than a year ago, the people of East Timor finally succeeded in exercising their right to self- determination. Angola feels pleased and compensated by this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the countries that fought in the United Nations and other international forums for the right of the Timorese people to freely choose their own destiny. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, which is responsible for the management of the transition period, cannot permit the current climate of violence, provoked by the militias with the objective of impeding the independence of the territory, to impose itself over the will of a people that has already suffered for decades the scourge of colonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly condemns these acts of violence, which have resulted in great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola appeals to the Security Council to take appropriate steps to ensure its immediate cessation. In the past two years, the world economy has registered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook Asia. The industrial economies and the so-called emerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving considerable rates of growth. However, the present world economic order continues to be marked by sharp distortions between North and South. While the North enjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues to suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to these ills are restrictive economic measures imposed unilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one example  its principal victims are the most vulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to support the lifting of the embargo. The international goal of reducing by one half, by the year 2015, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts, above all by the wealthiest countries and international financial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary to relieve the burden of external debt, whose service payments alone absorb a large part of the financial resources of developing countries. At the same time, steps will be necessary to attenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite the fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community in international economic relations, globalization has benefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped countries. The structural adjustment programmes under way in many developing countries should take account of real necessities and specifics, because many of the measures imposed by the international financial institutions have caused serious difficulties, above all of a social nature. To conclude my remarks, I would like to call attention to the need to pay more attention to the economic situation of the African continent. This should be done in such a way as to facilitate its integration into the world market, particularly through the transfer of technology and increasing productive investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n\t 2000 & 55 & ALB & Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, and to express my strong conviction that, under your guidance, the work of this session will be conducted successfully. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the work carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and for his competent guidance of the previous session. At the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a sovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to making its modest contribution, in the activities of the community of countries Members of the United Nations, to greater peace, stability, security and economic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating internal political and economic stability, as well as by pursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving constructive cooperation with the countries of South- Eastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session, Albania has been taking further steps towards consolidating its democratic institutions and constitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its economy and consolidating and ensuring respect for human rights. Because of the efficient measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to the help provided by our partners, Albania is recovering from the consequences of last year's conflict in Kosovo. Albania has become an open and safe country for foreign investment. The policies of the Albanian Government to privatize strategic sectors and absorb foreign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of security and public order, as well as the fight against organized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that are appreciated not only within my country, but elsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the establishment of the office of Ombudsman have further raised the level of protection of and respect for human rights in Albania. Albania is currently on the eve of local elections, which will be of fundamental importance for the future development of the country  not because of the results so much as because of the way in which the elections will be conducted. For this reason, the Albanian Government, in close cooperation with specialized international institutions, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Development Programme and others, has made every effort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and democratic. Albania has clearly expressed its intention to play a primary and constructive role in the common attempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and stable region, clearly aiming at European integration. The policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a requirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent expression of goodwill and mutual interest in the 8  protection of democratic institutions, fundamental freedoms, stability and prosperity in the region. Consequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded towards the creation of stable relations of mutual cooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to be a primary strategy for future European integration. Relations with these countries have been institutionalized not only bilaterally, but also multilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these relations common economic, political and security interests, as well as respect for human freedoms and rights, including those of national minorities living in the territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to make inter-Balkan relations follow the model of existing relations among European Union member countries, with the free movement of people, goods and capital. More than a year after the bloody conflict in Kosovo that endangered peace and stability in the region, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that the situation in Kosovo has improved significantly since the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the United Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by the war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the economy and of the common administration institutions has begun and the political situation and order in the country have improved significantly. The current situation in Kosovo contradicts the sceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and there, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against the establishment of the United Nations administration there. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a year ago will not fade, but will make us more conscious of the catastrophic consequences that the chauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to an innocent civilian population. In order to make a contribution to the founding of a democratic society in Kosovo in which human and national rights are fully respected, we have established very close relations with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their representatives. Albanians, even more than other people in the region, wish for and will welcome the democratization of Serbia, because, historically, they have suffered more than others from Serbian nationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up with reality, and we have to be realistic. Following very attentively the preparations for local elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government expresses its conviction that the political forces in Kosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in accordance with democratic principles and values, without acts of political violence. We would also like to express our sincere will for the full participation of the Serb community and of the other minorities in Kosovo in this electoral process because, as we have previously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and multicultural Kosovo. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the entire international community to apply stronger pressure against the Milosević regime in order to force him to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners and hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help bring the criminals who caused the massacres against the Kosovar population before the United Nations Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to strengthen the international police presence and to work on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect any kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it. I would also like to reiterate that the realization of United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the promises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar economy is of special importance. It should be included in regional cooperation projects, especially in the framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Although the Balkan political scenery has changed, and the countries of the region are engaged in a process of cooperation, there still exists a source of tension and conflict in the region, a source that has consequences for the countries of the region and beyond. It is Milosević's regime. He was not satisfied by the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he personally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is destroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining Yugoslavia. Next week, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Serbia. The current situation there indicates that very little chance exists for them to be free and fair. The recent amendments to the Yugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the opposition and the student movement and the 9  censorship and closing down of independent media are explicit facts proving that Milosević may transform these elections into a tool for illegally maintaining power. Like all the rest of the international community, the Albanian Government looks forward to genuine democratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces that possess new visions for the future of their country and of the whole region. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for the positive developments in Kosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to stabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic institutions there. As a neighbouring country, Albania closely follows developments in Montenegro. It condemns Milosević's attempts to destabilize that Republic and to undermine the democratic and integrative processes that are being undertaken by the legitimate Montenegrin leadership. Following the good- neighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the Albanian Government has recently developed intensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current relations have reached the highest level ever known, having been extended to areas of mutual interest, such as political, economic and trade cooperation, the free movement of people and so forth. It is our intention to further extend and strengthen these relations in the future. The countries in our region are involved in an already irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration. Not only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now aware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe, of the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is not integrated into the European Union. The regional conflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to understand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not only in the interest of its countries, but also in the interest of the European Union itself. An economically developed and democratically consolidated Balkans cannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The European integration of the Balkans and its development consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no importance whether a country tries to protect its democratic institutions, laws, public order or respect human rights; it can never attain the desired success if it is not economically developed. We are conscious that European integration is not an easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and difficult path. Before being integrated into the European Union, all the countries of our region should first be integrated among themselves, and existing societies in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect the best features of European civilization. In order to achieve this, we should first combat and overcome extreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and policies, because Europeanization means cooperation, tolerance and integration. The end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a turning point for the future of the Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best response to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like the European Union member countries, consider this initiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration of South-Eastern Europe into the European structures. The Albanian Government regards the implementation of the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities. Albania is highly appreciated by its international partners for the engagement and the responsibility it has shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the Stability Pact projects. We hope that the strong political will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end of the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by the will to finalize financial support for the rapid implementation of the Stability Pact projects. Albania's achievements in its domestic and foreign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its further integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The Albanian people have a clear European orientation, and that is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10 years have enjoyed their total support for their European integration policy. The present Albanian Government, representing and expressing the will of the people, has continuously fulfilled all the required conditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a higher level of relations with the European Union. We hope that in the near future the institutions of the European Union will approve the status report that the Albanian Government presented at Brussels several months ago. This approval will pave the way for the beginning of negotiations to reach Albania's association and stability agreement with the European Union. Albania's acceptance in the World Trade Organization in July this year was also an encouraging and very optimistic event in this respect. 10  The Albanian Government has welcomed the initiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of the European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in November this year. It is another affirmation of common efforts to further advance the democratization and integration processes in the region and the consolidation of security and stability there. The new century has started. We should keep on facing old problems, along with our new challenges. Some of those may be local crises, organized crime, traffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so forth, all of which require practical and well-oriented cooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of the world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia and so forth, made the role of such organizations as the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the other hand, the world has entered the era of globalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is unavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring negative consequences, especially to small and poor countries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is necessary to compile and to implement global strategies, and the United Nations can easily do that. Only a week has passed since one of the most distinguished events for the international community, the Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all the leaders of the world, where they affirmed their goodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the new millennium and in strengthening the United Nations. The Albanian Government hails the results of the Summit and expresses its conviction that all United Nations Member countries should unite all their forces for the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the final Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report: We must do more than talk about our future, however. We must start to create it. (A/54/2000, para. 17) It is time to take concrete steps in this direction.

                                                                        \\\\\n\t 2000 & 55 & AND & Andorra will become, through the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) rotation scheme, a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations at the beginning of 2001, for a period of three years. This is a great responsibility and a particular challenge for a small country that has only been a Member of the United Nations since 1993. My Minister of External Relations, Mr. Albert Pintat, would have loved to have been here today to express to Members Andorra's commitment to the goals of the United Nations and specially our obligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised the Brahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeeping operations, which my country supports. When he learned that he would be unable to lead this year's delegation to the United Nations, owing to unavoidable official functions in Europe, he asked me, in the light of our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC, to contribute to this general debate of the year 2000 with some free reflections — if possible innovative ones — on what globalization might mean for a small State. This is a daunting task since everything seems to have been said about the subject, but I shall try to dutifully carry out my Minister's instructions. First, however, let me convey to President Harri Holkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his election as President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, while thanking his predecessor, Theo-Ben Gurirab, for a difficult job well done. When I was a student here in the United States many years ago, I took a course in photography. I had taken from my family's house in Andorra a negative — it was one of the older glass negatives — and there in the university photography lab I set it up for developing. I remember that moment when I peered into the developer tray and saw, slowly forming on the white photographic paper, an image, the image of my great grandmother. It was a shock, there in New Haven, to see this face from a long distant past, from long before I was born, come slowly into clarity. A lost image from a lost past. If I had the time, and Members the inclination, I could tell them about my great-grandmother, a formidable woman who never left the Valley of Andorra, high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. I could tell them what her face, strong and hard as the stone of the mountains, says about the history of my country. In the photograph, she is dressed all in black, and looks away from the camera, down at the rocky ground. Behind her, one can see the stones of the 16  family farm, high up in the mountains above Saint Julia, one of the seven parishes that make up the Principality of Andorra. Her Andorra is very different from the country today. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone- strewn fields are now covered with shops, houses and hotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that are the pride of my country, churches that date back to the foundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth century and that loomed over the villages for almost a millennium, are now hemmed in by concrete buildings — stores, apartments, houses, the same buildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Beijing or New York. Yes, so much has changed since my grandfather's hand snapped this picture. My great-grandmother would recognize only the church towers and the stones of the mountains. And what was so specific about her world — the stories, the cooking, the fabric of daily life — well, that has disappeared. In the space of 70 years, Andorra has changed from being a poor and remote place to a prosperous country, with over 10 million tourists a year, who come for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. We are now a commercial hub. If you look for a country transformed by globalization, you might look to Andorra. Andorra is a country that has survived, independent and uninvaded, since 1278. It is one of the oldest and one of the smallest democracies in the world. A historian might argue that this remarkable fact is due to its isolation and poverty, or because for centuries the outside world was neatly balanced by its co-Princes — the Bishop of Urgell to the south, and to the north the Count of Foix, later the French King and since 1805 the head of the French State. Unsurprisingly, I might attribute the remarkable record of peace to the cautious character of the Andorran people. Or rather — and less partially — I think that because it is a small country, where parishes have been able to readily communicate with one another at the Casa de la Vall, the House of the Valleys, communication never broke down. The Millennium Summit of the United Nations had as its theme globalization. As a summit, it was aptly named, since I would say that globalization is the story of the second millennium — indeed perhaps it is the story of human culture. I am a politician, not a historian, but we all know the effect on both Europe and the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, or the transformation of indigenous and European cultures brought about by the “discovery” of the New World, or the effect of the slave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on both Africa and the Americas. These violent encounters formed the world even as they brought death and destruction. They also sparked our imaginations. The Globe was the name of Shakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London, a joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like to think of the United Nations as the new Globe, a theatre in which we are the players or — if we have the imagination — the dramatists for the story of our fragile planet. But the globalization we are now facing is of a different nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in his opening introduction to the Millennium conference, the starting point for this millennium can be summed up in one word: “globalization” — the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village. It is an idyllic view, the view of the world as a village. Of course, the Secretary-General is all too aware of the negative effects of the process. In the same introduction, he cautions: “Globalization offers great opportunities, but at present its benefits are very unevenly distributed while its costs are borne by all. “Thus the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people.” (A/54/2000, paras. 13 and 14) We all know the protests that have taken place, and will take place, against this same word, “globalization”. Let us listen, for instance, to one of the interested groups, chosen at random, the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), which understands the term as referring to a “globalized economic system dominated by supranational corporate trade and banking institutions that are not accountable to democratic processes or national Governments”. The IFG accuses “the GATT, WTO, Maastricht, NAFTA, combined with structural adjustment policies of the IMF and the World Bank, to be direct stimulants to the 17  processes that weaken democracy, create a world order that is under the control of transnational corporations, and that devastate the natural world”. According to the IFG, globalization brings the diminishment of powers of local and indigenous communities, States and even nations, destroys both small-scale agriculture and the earth's remaining wilderness, and brings a worldwide homogenization of diverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter its effects, the IFG advocates the revitalization of local communities by promoting maximum self-reliance, the recognition of rights of indigenous peoples and the abandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economic growth. When I listen to these words, I cannot help but hear a lament, a lament for a lost and simpler world: the world of my great-grandmother. And I am reminded of that greatest of all laments for lost culture, the work that indeed informs the thinking behind the activists who struggle against the forces of globalization — Claude Lévi-Strauss and his masterpiece, Tristes Tropiques, his elegy for the people of the Amazon basin, which even as he captured it on paper was disappearing into our modern world. I understand the sadness for the lost world, the world of the past that is always slipping away from us, that exists in the black-and-white negative of our memory. And so here I elegize, before this Assembly, all that has disappeared, not simply in Andorra but in the world, all that has been forgotten, paved over by the forces of travel, of tourism, of telephone, television, cinema and the Internet. These technologies link the world; they narrow its distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of the globe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listeners now: what new discoveries await us? We cannot imagine them, but they will come, and sooner than we think, in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours. And yet, and yet ... The IFG manifesto was not posted on a church door in Wittenburg, printed in a new technology that sparked another revolution, the Reformation of the sixteenth century. No, it was downloaded from a web site on the Internet. This Web — in which ideas, images, voices travel across our globe in a flash — is a remarkable invention that collapses both time and space. In the same way, I now realize that my image of my great-grandmother came from a negative, from a camera — a technology that perhaps more than any other, besides the computer, has transformed and quickened the pace of our world. This is to make a very simple point: not simply that this manifesto is presented in the very technology of globalization, but that nostalgia for a local economy might be a product of globalization itself. My great-grandmother had a good life, but a hard one, with terrible cold in the winter and constant work. Would she have chosen this life, if she could have had another? If she had known another? And more to the point, would she have been allowed to choose? We need to remember that people themselves have embraced change. Real people who are not content to live — physically or imaginatively — in their places of birth, but, filled with a desire to better their lives or to see the world, they reach out and try to grasp change, if only to know what they have lost. Lévi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognize that people he observed, deep in the Amazon rain forests, might want to leave their paradise — not because they were driven out by modernity, the modernity that Lévi-Strauss himself made so much of, but because they wanted to better their lives, to embrace the world, to feel for themselves the painful pulse of gain and loss. We need only leave this Hall and walk through any street in the city to recognize this. People from all across the world, people of all races, walking up and down, alone or in conversation, happy or unhappy, homesick or embracing the dreams this city seems to proffer. In the streets, we see restaurants that offer wonderful meals from all around the world, and fusion restaurants: French-Senegalese, American-Thai. Or fusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris or Hong Kong or Andorra la Vella, the people are changing, colours are shifting. What brave new world is being born around us? In saying this, I do not want to contradict the concerns of the anti-globalists, to in any way deny their recognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at our peril practical questions that turn around international finance, international corporations, the widening gulf between have and have-not countries, the dangers to the environment. 18  These are practical matters to be seen to. To paraphrase Annan, we need mechanisms to equalize the benefits of globalization, to make life a positive thing for all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest for superfluous material goods, but shelter and health and protection from disease. And I would add, simply, that before and during my tenure here as Ambassador, the United Nations hosted a series of summits or conferences designed to address these very problems — Rio, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Beijing, Rome, just to name a few. The world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the world summit for children and Rio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body of work in place to address the stresses of globalization. What we need to do now is continue to work towards our goals. In conclusion, I would like to consider a presupposition of both global optimists and pessimists: the notion that globalization has replaced nationalism. Again, to quote Kofi Annan, globalization means “the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village”. Similarly, the report published in The New York Times concerning the protests against globalization stated that “speakers do not oppose globalization per se, because, in their view, the era of nation-States is coming to its inevitable end”. Are globalization and nationalism opposed? On the surface, they would appear to be. So much of globalization — economies that transcend borders, communication networks that shrink the world — seems to render an earlier model of the nation-State obsolete. And yet, whether it be the ethnic conflicts in Rwanda or in the Balkans, issues of immigration in the developed world or conflict in East Timor, we know that the question of the border, of the passport, remains increasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness, nationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of a nationalism no longer linked to true patriotism, that is to the love of a place. I pray that the world does not succumb to an unthinking nationalism that would exist simply to exclude or to feed the ambitions of unscrupulous politicians. We need a democratic nationalism forged out of a concern for the rights of individuals. That is not nationalism as it worked out from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries — a nationalism linked to the struggle to control markets, to the scramble for loot — but a new nationalism that is not predicated on identity, on cultural sameness, a nationalism that is linked to a world economy that is no longer restricted by national borders, a democratic or civic nationalism, a global nationalism. This would be a new nationalism, I must add, in which Andorra and other small countries are not historical anachronisms, but are emblematic of this civic nationalism, predicated as it must be on the democratic will of the people. In this sense, Andorra's quiet patriotism, its 700 years of peace and communication, can modestly serve as a kind of historical model. Countries need to rethink what it means to be a nation in order to participate effectively in the life of this our globe, in order to become what we must be and to a certain extent already are: united nations. In its very name, in its very mission, the United Nations anticipated the globalization that is so rapidly occurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war and later by nuclear war, forged from the most terrible of national struggles, the United Nations is an activist forum for issues that are global, not in the sense that they transcend any individual nation, but in the sense that they are of concern to all nations. The International Criminal Court, whose statute will soon be ratified by Andorra, a country which had the honour of contributing to it by composing the first paragraphs of the preamble, is a good example of an entity that respects borders but that places human rights above all. Crimes against humanity must be punished, and shall be. This new nationalism, while it recognizes borders, asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty and peace are primary. Hence, the United Nations, even as it respects national borders, needs to recognize that it can and should become proactive in the protection of those rights in the case of civil conflict. So too, the great global threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases demands a response from each nation and a recognition that these threats can never be adequately dealt with alone, but only by working globally through the United Nations. In short, we need not only the United Nations, but, as many have said, we need united nations. 19  I began this speech with the image of my great- grandmother looking down at the stony ground of her country. I would end it, symbolically at least, with another image: our image. Someday, our great- grandchildren may discover our image, perhaps even our image here in this place. Perhaps they will reproduce it through a technology so strange, so remarkable, we cannot even imagine it. But let us hope that they live in the brave new world I have spoken of today. And let us hope that they see us as an image of positive change. We who have lived through such change cannot turn away from it. With our feet on the ground of this great globe of ours, we need to look forward. We need to grasp change. We need to reach out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n\t 2000 & 55 & ARE & I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere congratulations and regards on your election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of this session's proceedings. We also thank your predecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which 16  he directed the work of the previous session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for the efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. The convening of the Millennium Summit a few days ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment of the political will of the leaders of the world to deal effectively with the problems and challenges that face the international community, such as the proliferation of proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing poverty and debt, as well as other attendant transnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime, international terrorism, environmental pollution, persistent violations of human rights and the disparities resulting from globalization and information technology. The consequences of these prevailing conditions have, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness of the importance of adhering to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of consolidating the rule of international law through the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the principle of equality and the right to self- determination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of cooperation and tolerance among the different cultures, beliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for achieving the desired security, stability and human development. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome of the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Yemen, as an important political and historic event that will promote confidence-building measures and good neighbourly relations. At the same time, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow the example of those fraternal States and to respond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either entering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran's occupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice. In this context, we would like to reaffirm that all actions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic Republic of Iran on those three islands and its continued construction of military and civilian installations on them, are illegal measures considered null and void, and do not establish or entail any legal rights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In fact, they represent a violation of the territorial sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and contravene the principles and purposes of the Charters of both the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian peaceful intentions in the region. More than a year has elapsed since the Gulf Cooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial Committee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, with developing a mechanism for direct negotiations between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of the endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the reinforcement of the foundations of peace and security in the Arab Gulf region. Despite the fact that almost ten years have elapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab Gulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of that War. Consequently, it is imperative that political and diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a peaceful solution that would lead to ending the human suffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we invite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely fulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to the release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of war or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti property, in implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard, we would like to underline the importance of respecting the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as refraining from the threat or use of force, in order to ensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the region. The Middle East peace process recently witnessed important developments during which major efforts were exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable and fair solutions based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible and constructive proposals put forward by the Palestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the Israeli Government persisted in its positions of procrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to 17  abide by the agreements it had concluded with the Palestinian side. Thus, in affirming our position of solidarity with the fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership, represented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our call to the co-sponsors of the peace process — in particular the United States of America — and the other active States to continue exerting political and diplomatic efforts that support and promote negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, with the aim of finding a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this settlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al- Sharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Also in this context we reaffirm our unceasing support of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to regain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967. We call on the international community to demand that Israel resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the interest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all the States and peoples of the region. The United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once again fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory, expresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete the extension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil. In the same vein, we support the demands of sisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on it be lifted, particularly since it has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions. We also express our satisfaction at the outcome of the recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti and invite all Somali factions to reinforce national unity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and sustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the region of the Horn of Africa. The growing number of problems resulting from the continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing in some parts of the African continent, the Balkans, South Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of constant concern for the international community. Consequently, we support all regional and international efforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful means, and we emphasize that just and lasting resolution of these issues cannot be attained until the parties concerned demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate their commitment to implement relevant Security Council resolutions. Despite international unanimity, shown in the Disarmament Conference and other international forums, regarding the need to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a matter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned at this time as some States are striving to outdo each other in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in particular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a means of settling their territorial disputes. Since such actions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic security balance, at both the regional and international levels, we call upon the States concerned to review their policies in this respect and to promote the establishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean. We also urge the international community to demand once again that the Israeli Government accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and agree to subject its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Despite the multidimensional changes that the world economy is witnessing as a result of the deregulation of markets, globalization and modern technology, the economic and social gap between the developed and developing States still exists and is growing — thereby exacerbating poverty and unemployment, environmental degradation and debt accumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium Summit and the Summit's Declaration highlight the great importance our countries attach to these issues. This makes it incumbent on all of us to work assiduously on carrying out the commitments and undertakings contained therein regarding the creation of an environment favourable to development, elimination of poverty and free access for the exports of the least developed countries to the markets of industrialized countries. I confirm the determination of the United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to 18  work towards narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. The United Arab Emirates continues its sustained efforts in support of economic- and social-development projects in many countries of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, be it through direct participation in financing such projects or by supporting international and regional efforts to attain those goals. Finally, the ever-increasing burden of economic, social and human development, which is the first safeguard of the political stability that we desire, demands that mechanisms for regional and international cooperation, foremost among which is the United Nations, be created. Hence, we call for continued efforts to carry out the structural reform and development of the world Organization, in particular the Security Council and the General Assembly, so that the Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes in international relations.

                              \\\\\n\t 2000 & 55 & ARG & In this, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to emphasize the great friendship that unites the Argentine Republic and Finland. I also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to Argentina, for the constructive way in which he presided over the Assembly's work at the last session. We also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon its entry into the United Nations and extend our friendship and cooperation to its people. This debate is taking place after a very productive exchange of opinions at the highest level during the Millennium Summit, which we hope will mark, together with the final Declaration, the beginning of a new era leading to a more equitable world and a more effective Organization, in accordance with objectives set out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled “We the peoples”. For my country, this is also an opportunity to set out before the General Assembly the principles and objectives of our foreign policy. The Government of President Fernando de la Rúa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has drafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it received from the Argentine people. This policy aims at strengthening our integration with neighbouring countries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and promoting economic development, social progress, free trade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction. Argentina is determined to participate on the international scene jointly to build a peaceful and stable world based on the values of representative democracy, the rule of law, the protection and promotion of human rights, respect for the environment, economic liberalization, social progress, international cooperation and the maintenance of international peace and security, pursuant to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was stated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are shared by the vast majority of Members of this Organization. On the basis of its ongoing interests, the Government has set as a priority objective its political and economic integration with the other States members of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) — Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have agreed with these countries to consolidate MERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to promote greater integration on the basis of balance and equity. We have made significant progress towards the expansion of our markets since the signing of the Treaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of the determination of the member countries to implement an open trade policy in their economic programmes. 25  The creation of MERCOSUR was a political decision transcending the economic sphere. MERCOSUR provides a political forum within which trust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in all areas foster the increasing complementarity and convergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have bound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate members in the context of the Free Trade Area and we trust that they will become full members in the near future. As a consequence of the broadening political and economic dimensions of our integration project, we are also witnessing the convergence of approaches to defence and security in our region. This contributes to a continental perspective based on confidence and cooperation. We and our neighbours have made progress towards the creation of the joint MERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace. Argentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America reflecting the peaceful and cooperative security necessary to harmonious development. At the same time, as a member of the Rio Group, which has now grown to include Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its high-level political consultations and cooperation in order to maintain peace, strengthen representative democracy and promote sustainable development in the region. It is our firm intention that our countries shall enjoy greater participation in the global economy. At the recent summit convened in Brasilia to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American countries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and harmony that marks its relations on the basis of these principles and objectives. The consolidation of democratic stability in Latin America continues to be a central policy of the Argentine Government. We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of others and we respect international law. We promote the consolidation of democratic processes on the basis of our deep conviction that free, regular and transparent elections and a plurality of political parties are essential instruments for affirming and guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy. My country also reaffirms its commitment to eradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and to ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region. We shall continue to pursue our joint action in the regional and global campaign against drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and organized crime. The Argentine Republic has a natural interest in the South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin American countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting held in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action was adopted to implement our shared objectives in the peaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation, development, the conservation of fishery resources, the fight against drug trafficking and the protection of the environment. My country is in favour of free trade in order to achieve development and the eradication of poverty. The Argentine Government believes that protectionism not only generates the deflection of trade and the closure of markets, but also constitutes a form of discrimination. Argentina urges the entire international community to commit itself seriously to eliminating distortions of trade and will continue to fight for these objectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is being made in negotiations on the free trade agreement of the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area by the year 2005. In the World Trade Organization, our country has provided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new round to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in agriculture. Argentina also continues to support negotiations to develop political and economic association between MERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in this framework, the gradual liberalization of agricultural trade and services. We are constantly seeking new ways to integrate ourselves with the world. The realities of technological change and continual innovation require developing countries to adapt to a scheme of international economic integration based on a new paradigm of production. The challenge is to ensure the access of the least developed countries to this process of constant technological change and innovation. There can be no doubt that the international community — in particular the United Nations — must cooperate to promote the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that 26  technological innovations reach those countries with fewer resources. In his report “We the peoples”, the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this task. Without the adequate dissemination of and access to the new technologies of the digital revolution, we will see the gap between rich and poor widen. Individual States and the international community as a whole must therefore find solutions that guarantee greater fairness in the use of digital information. Argentina remains fully committed to the international community's efforts to protect the environment from the negative impact of human activities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to the principles of sustainable development agreed upon in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development — principles that were reflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment and in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the importance of making adequate preparation — during this very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for the conference to be held in 2002 to review the implementation of Agenda 21. Moreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate the international legal regimes in the field of environmental protection. In this context, and bearing in mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric warming on the global ecosystem and on human life, we attach special importance to the entry into force, as soon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The twenty-first century was preceded by a prolonged strategic and ideological confrontation, which has given way to a moment in history in which representative democracy, human rights and open economies are shared values. At the same time, we are facing a more complex world that has yet to engender a stable international order. The explosion of serious intra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkans or in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a new stage in conflicts — a stage in which, regrettably, conflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious differences. The Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute to achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing and neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the development of nations. We believe that if this consensus were based on greater democratization in international relations this would increase the efficacy and the functioning of the international system. Since it is impossible for individual States to face these threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative security policies to eliminate the potential risk of conflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of legal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united fashion the immediate and underlying causes of conflicts, which often arise because of the lack of economic opportunities and because of social inequalities. The Members of the United Nations face the challenge of finding a response to questions raised by recent international crises, including the international humanitarian crises. My country believes that the principle of non-intervention must be duly respected because it is the pillar underpinning relations between independent States. At the same time, we cannot conceal our concern at the explosion of violence against ethnic, racial or religious minorities. In particular we are concerned about the situation of vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally displaced persons, and about the situation of children in armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the international community cannot remain indifferent and must provide an adequate response to humanitarian crises. We must emphasize the role that can be played by international tribunals to create awareness that impunity will not be tolerated. The International Criminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been created, constitute important instruments of deterrence. In addition to the internal reforms that the Secretary-General has initiated with singular success within his sphere of competence, the United Nations must give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main and subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be done in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and effectively with which solutions are found to the daily problems facing the Organization. Maintenance of international peace and security is a primary responsibility of the Security Council, which must be strengthened. If these responsibilities are not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United 27  Nations can be carried out with any certainty of success. Since the inception of multilateral diplomacy, Argentina has defended the principle of the sovereign equality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our country maintains that the reform of the Security Council must be arrived at via consensus, and this consensus must not entail new discrimination, privileges or exclusions. The vast majority of the international community — seeking to ensure respect for the values of democracy and universality — believes that a new Security Council will have to allow for greater participation by all. This cannot be achieved if new permanent seats — like those established in 1945 — are established. Reform of the Council must allow all States a greater opportunity to participate in the Council, which must not be monopolized by only a few countries. For this reason, Argentina supports exclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictions on the right of the veto, without losing sight of the ultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We support the adoption of rules of procedure that guarantee transparency and the possibility of the participation of all Member States in this organ. Our support for the peaceful settlement of disputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our foreign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated the Argentine commitment to continue participating in peacekeeping operations established by the Security Council. The most recent conflicts have shown how important efficient training of the forces participating in these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina in 42 years of participating in these missions is reflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre for training for peacekeeping operations. It has been operating since 1995, with the participation of personnel from other Member States. We also established the centre for training of security forces for foreign missions. Argentina, which is currently involved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the disposal of the United Nations its military and police training centres. We also support the initiatives to strengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the Organization, and we would support restructuring efforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support for peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and in the field. My country was pleased to receive the conclusions and recommendations recently issued by the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and contained in the Brahimi report. These provide a valuable basis for building international consensus aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization to prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish peace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the Special Committee for Peacekeeping Operations, supports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a detailed analysis of the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report — including its possible financial implications — with a view to achieving its early implementation. My Government is particularly concerned about the problems related to the security and protection of those who participate in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions. The personnel of the United Nations and associated personnel, as well as the personnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian assistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as we have seen recently in the tragic events that have occurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina, which is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged an improvement in the security situation of United Nations personnel via the adoption of practical and legal measures, including financial-planning and implementation measures for these operations. In this context we should also reiterate the duty of the international community to provide assistance to those countries facing emergency situations, which arise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed conflicts. In this area a significant role can be played by the “White Helmets” initiative, which involves the establishment of bodies of specialized volunteers organized by the Members of the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are victims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the serious problems that affect these people. We should also mention the issue of AIDS which particularly affects the poorest areas of the world. More than 34 million people suffer from this illness today. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular, more than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan Africa. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The illness and death of so many workers is draining already weakened economies. The impact of this phenomenon on the future of the affected regions will 28  probably mean greater marginalization and will undermine the foundations of stability, security and peace. The international community and this Organization and its specialized agencies must contribute urgently all available resources to the fight against this disease. I would like to refer in particular to the sovereignty dispute between my country and the United Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the surrounding seas. The recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty over this part of our national territory, respecting the interests of the inhabitants and international law, is a precept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina. This item is on the agenda of the Organization, which in numerous resolutions has requested the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to renew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution to the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833. Today, in accordance with that request, Argentina reiterates once again its complete willingness to renew bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to resolve this question. We reiterate our support for the mission of good offices with which the General Assembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the parties in achieving this objective. The world stage in the post-cold-war era is the scene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal traffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we are seeing the unprecedented spread of representative democracy and economic and technological modernization. Against this backdrop, our main task is to reach agreements that will enable us to face these challenges and seize these opportunities in the best way possible. Equipping the United Nations for the challenges of the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All Member States must undertake to fulfil this commitment if our efforts are to be crowned with success. Argentina is committed to this task and will continue making its contribution. On 31 December next, my country will end its term as a member of the Security Council. During its two-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to contribute constructively to decision-making and consensus-building on all items on the Council's agenda. On the basis of our potential and bearing in mind the features of the current international situation, Argentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to continue to play an active part in the consolidation of peace and international security and in the development of peoples.\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n","text/plain":"  year session country\n1 2000 55      AFG    \n2 2000 55      AGO    \n3 2000

                                                       \n1 On my way to the Assembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State Council of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a self-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani military personnel — army, plain-clothes personnel and armed Taliban — are reported to have been positioned in the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border town of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound for an attack on Badakhshan province. On behalf of my delegation, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the major task of presiding over the important millennium session of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on his excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, which set the stage for the Millennium Summit. Three years ago, I stood before the Assembly and stated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in Afghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and answer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the dark and ominous movement known as the Taliban, which, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded Afghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the General Assembly indeed has to answer major questions. One among many is the silence the world has chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their Pakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism, which has led to the abject misery of the Afghan nation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region and beyond, is it not high time that the international community put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban processing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and inadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this view that I should like to focus my statement entirely on the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating regional and international implications, within the given time limit. 4 A question arises: what has been the result of the Talibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In an age of information and globalization, it has been a reign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in the name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms and civil liberties, massive violations of human rights, degrading and tormenting treatment of men and women, trafficking of women and girls, the forced separation of women from their menfolk, the random and deliberate round-up of individuals based on their ethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorchedearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of farmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the contamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch of children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of all but rudimentary religious education — for male students only — with the closure of all schools for females, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the situation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of the historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in order to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry and historical identity. The objective of the Pakistani military intelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to create instability in Central and South Asia by means of terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has instituted Mullah Omar, the militia's leader, as the undisputed Amir-ul-Mo'mineen, meaning “Commander of the faithful” not only in Afghanistan, but in theory throughout the Muslim world. The process the Pakistani military intelligence has chosen for the realization of its objective is to transform the Afghan nation into an exhausted, devastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation struggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to turn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit activities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other crimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing centres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act as the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan continues to carry out these activities under the name of Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment that such activities have led to the defamation of both the noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims throughout the world. In short, the Afghan nation has become the direct victim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani military's hegemonic interests in the region. These diabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military intelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution, while the implied risk and perilous consequences for the very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are overlooked. As the world is gradually awakening to the creeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that some “civilized” nations, on certain occasions, have preferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban, an entity which has failed to meet the minimum standard of being considered civilized, while having championed terrorism, human rights violations and crimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only Pakistan's military junta has continuously given its full blessing to the movement. At least until early May of this year, the official position of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and officials strangely claimed, was that it maintained contacts with both parties to the conflict. However, Pakistan's News Network International (NNI) news agency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez Musharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policy was “in accordance with Pakistan's national interest.” Advocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of Pakistan, the General was quoted as saying, “We have a national security interest, both demographic and geographic.” He further stated that in the realization of this security interest, “Pashtoons should be on our side and they”, meaning Pashtoons, “are represented by Taliban.” The world must know that in a flagrant violation of recognized international norms and principles and in clear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler of the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous pretext of national security interest, has claimed the right to impose a certain ethnic group through the invocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the cost of the sovereignty and political independence of Afghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and, prior to that, of the League of Nations, long before Pakistan was even born. It is important to remember that terrorist training camps operating from the Taliban-held territories of Afghanistan, including those established by the infamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has 5 been repeatedly called for by the United Nations and the entire international community, have been established by Pakistan's military intelligence through the Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks. They continue to utilize these territories as a ground for training, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements seeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the region and beyond. This is done under the guise of Islam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani hegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and activities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of the Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is high time that the Security Council, in accordance with relevant resolutions, undertook appropriate enforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the prime source of sponsorship of these activities. The Security Council, in its unanimously adopted resolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly demanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from sheltering, supporting and training terrorists and planning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other countries and that it extradite to the requesting States those indicted for committing international acts of terrorism. The recent upsurge of terrorist activities in Central Asian countries and beyond, emanating from the Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires drastic measures by the Security Council against the militia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration of the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the expansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999), which must include the end of terrorist activities in all forms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of Afghanistan, could adequately, among other things, serve the cause of peace and security in the region. Here I would like to welcome the proposal by the Republic of Uzbekistan for convening an international conference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the evil phenomenon of terrorism. In spite of the current devastating drought in Afghanistan — the most severe in 30 years — Afghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics. The production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by the Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan, account for considerable revenue, which is used to finance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to considerable transnational organized crime, while adding to the number of addicts, both at home and abroad. Among the many deliberate violations and instances of absolute disregard for international humanitarian law and the numerous crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban and their outside supporters in the year 2000, one could mention the following cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of 198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as hostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August of the United Nations mine-clearance employees affiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid that, according to the European Union, in the light of the devastating drought constituted a breach of international humanitarian law; the forced blood-drawing and organ removal of innocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in August; the forced deportation of the civilian populations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the closing down in August, as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from working, of all bakeries run by the United Nations World Food Programme in which widows were paid to make bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to other widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul alone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the north due to renewed Taliban military onslaughts. We believe that the commission of those heinous crimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to the lack of adequate response by the Security Council and the international community to bring to justice the perpetrators and others involved in incidents at Bamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in 1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings of Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military adviser to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998. It is significant to note that the Taliban continue to deprive women of their fundamental rights, including the right to education, which affects over 100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are still barred from employment by the Taliban. While the predictable results will speak for themselves, present 6 and future female generations of Afghanistan will be illiterate. The cultural and social impact of that criminal act on the country's future generations will be enormous. Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a fact well known to the international community. The hundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting alongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the Government; the mortal remains of hundreds of Pakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and identification cards obtained from their pockets; the intercepted radio transmissions; and the massive logistical support and the overt supply of large quantities of military hardware and ammunition, all prove the direct involvement of Pakistani army personnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General Rustam of Pakistan's armed forces, who is currently stationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, commands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations in the north. He has been assisted by two of bin Laden's henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them were involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and in the atrocities committed against the civilian population. It is important to mention that the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs magazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis having fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in excess of 80,000. A breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed contingents, including units from the North-West Frontier Corps and different commando units, have actively participated in battles on various occasions; Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the planning and command and control of both intelligence operations and logistical support; ex-commissioned officers in charge of tactical operations, artillery support and logistics; frontier militia units; paramilitary members of extremist terrorist groups affiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the Sepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and the so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or religious schools. Other categories of foreign fighters in Afghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and its affiliated units from around the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups from Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In addition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were educated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are dispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally, there are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons from around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon fodder. In this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan appeals to the Security Council to mandate the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an investigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report to the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani armed men and Arab fighters who are working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries. This would break the silence that has thus far encouraged further Pakistani intervention in Afghanistan. I should like to remind the Assembly that only those Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will be immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of Afghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment. One must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah indirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace initiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that peace has no place in the Taliban agenda. While striving for the realization of noble human values and principles — the institution of a democratic system, the observance of human rights, including those of women and girls, civil liberties and elections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates its firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for the formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully representative Government through a workable mechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or loya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the auspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as Pakistan continues to directly and massively intervene in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan considers the task of defending the territorial integrity, national unity and political independence of Afghanistan its immediate priority. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has high expectations that the United Nations and the international community will exert pressure on Pakistan to immediately cease its intervention in Afghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel and armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the Security Council will address the question of foreign 7 intervention, the existence of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; that the Organization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its view of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken and carried out in the name of Islam — which we believe distort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its tenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug Control Programme will assist the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and the international community will step up their efforts for an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan conflict; and that the international community will provide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and drought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I should like to mention that the current drought, the most severe in 30 years, will have tremendous humanitarian repercussions. We remain thankful for the statements made by the heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and in the General Assembly expressing their legitimate concerns over the dangers emanating from the Pakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan. We deeply appreciate and support the indefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no stone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries concerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. I should like to conclude by stating that the United Nations cannot embark on the new millennium without appropriately addressing the issues enshrined in its Charter, among others, the question of noninterference. Neither can this international body advocate globalization in its true sense when Talibanization is threatening regional stability in our part of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta will remain the prime actor in this dreadful and immense tragedy in Asia. Like many others afflicted with the Taliban plague, we wonder how far the evil threat of Talibanism will spread, how many more souls it will bury and how many new borders it must cross before the conscience of the international community is awakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate and drastic preventive measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n2 Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate, in particular, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise and dynamic manner in which he carried out his mandate. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish efforts to make the United Nations an increasingly effective instrument, capable of dealing with the demands of our times and finding and implementing solutions for the most pressing problems of the world. Just a few days ago, during the Millennium Summit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and expressed the need to adapt its structure for the demands and challenges of the future. During that event of transcendental importance for the lives of the people of this planet, the indispensable and irreplaceable character of the United Nations in international relations was reaffirmed. Member States reiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the United Nations as a privileged mechanism for international dialogue and cooperation in the name of peace and well-being of all peoples. Indeed, given the role of the United Nations as guarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is urgent that we begin the implementation of actions aimed at adapting its internal structure to new world realities. This will permit the Organization to deal rapidly and effectively with the main problems of the world and avoid having its members resort to solutions outside the established framework of its main organs  namely, the General Assembly and the Security Council. In recent years, the United Nations sought, through world summits, to find global solutions with broad international consensus for the many misfortunes that afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of the environment, violations of human rights and inadequate social development, among others. Various plans of action were outlined. However, the problems 12  they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have even become worse. A revision of the mechanism for implementing decisions is needed, through a revitalization and strengthening of the United Nations system, particularly that of its principal bodies, such as the Security Council. From our point of view, that body requires greater internal democracy, and its composition should reflect the current membership in the Organization and its geographic diversity. We think that, in this way, its decision-making would be faster and its performance in the area of peacekeeping and international security more effective. The persistence of a climate of insecurity and instability in a number of regions of the world cannot be attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems from weakness in the international security system. A reflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for example, in the early warning system and in the peacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not always corresponded to the desired objectives, either because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not sent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are not provided with adequate human, material and financial resources. Sometimes this is due to the ambiguity in the mission mandate itself. We recognize that the effectiveness of action in the area of peace and international security does not depend only on United Nations activities. There has to be renewed commitment on the part of each and every State. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent publication of the Brahimi report. It is our understanding that the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels should be made part of this commitment in order to eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In the particular case of the African continent, the continent most affected by the scourge of war, the illicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of support for wars incited by some rebel groups with the objective of overturning democratically elected regimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with the aim of reducing access of these conflict diamonds to the international market. My Government supports these initiatives and will provide any cooperation necessary for their implementation. Another serious issue affecting international security is the circulation and transfer of small arms that flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups. This takes place with the connivance of certain Governments and networks of transnational organized crime. The lack of international legal instruments capable of controlling transactions of these arms is stimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above all in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of conflicts and making their resolution even more difficult. According to United Nations data, the effects of these arms on civil populations are shocking. They have already resulted in more deaths than the two world wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict diamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes special importance for Angola. It is through the sale of illegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which they then undertook a large-scale military campaign aimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a procession of death and destruction, and it is the principal reason for the economic instability in Angola. This scenario is repeating itself in other regions of Africa and the world. For this reason, a solution is urgently required. The economic and social development and subsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for human rights, democracy and good governance can only be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and stability. It is in this context that my Government established, as a priority, the restoration of definitive peace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this objective, the general situation in Angola has significantly improved. It is for this reason that today we are more confident than ever of a future of peace, development and prosperity. Indeed, the war has ceased to have the same intensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict itself is moving progressively towards an end. The political and military measures undertaken by the Government have significantly reduced the ability of the rebels to wage war. These measures have also allowed the Government to resume control over nearly the entire country. More than 12,000 rebel military personnel have abandoned their arms and joined the efforts of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who persist in waging war have less and less space, and their activities are limited today to isolated armed attacks against civilian targets, the objective being to destroy and loot the people's property. 13  The military measures undertaken by the Government represent a necessary and legitimate recourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the rebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very existence of the Angolan democratic system. However, despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the total control of our national borders and the elimination of the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are having a positive impact in the search for peace, they do not constitute our only option for the resolution of armed conflict. Simultaneously, we will continue to implement other actions aimed at guaranteeing the total implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us continues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the Angolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our readiness to continue to integrate in our society all those who choose to abandon the option of war. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, still has an active role to play in the process of restoring peace in Angola, through the continued implementation and strengthening of sanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. The recent nomination by the Secretary-General of the members of the mechanism to monitor the application of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1295 (2000), will contribute to greater international vigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny bases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will extend their cooperation to that body. The significant improvement of the situation in Angola, however, has not brought an immediate end to the effects of war on the lives of the people. The humanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for that reason we appeal to the international community to increase its assistance to the needy populations. The positive evolution of the situation is not limited to the politico-military field; it has also carried over into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues on the path of economic reforms which have earned the confidence of international financial institutions. This progress translated to the recent signature of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund relating to the implementation of a monitored programme. We hope that the international community will contribute substantially through the investment of capital during the recovery phase of the Angolan economy in supporting stability and growth. Angola adopted legislation to protect foreign investment by providing incentives and guarantees. The international situation continues to be characterized by violence and tension in various parts of the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace and stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for stability and development in the central region of Africa. The situation in that neighbouring country, which shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common border with Angola, remains quite volatile and complex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if appropriate measures are not taken. The resolution of the Congolese conflict must come about, fundamentally, through the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In spite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new reading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to all the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Invading forces should withdraw completely from Congolese territory and cease immediately their support for the destabilization of that country. These conditions, in addition to the inter- Congolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base including the unequivocal recognition of the authority of the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the success of the peace process. Angola reiterates its commitment to continue to make the necessary efforts, together with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement, until a way out of the conflict is found. In Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities continues to delay the pacification of the country. Angola supports regional initiatives aimed at reactivating the peace process and condemns the attacks against United Nations personnel and forces. We support steps aimed at bringing to international justice the principal parties responsible for the atrocities committed against the people of that country. In Somalia, the progress reached at the national conference led to the re-establishment of some national institutions and moved the country closer to peace. 14  Angola encourages the continuation of these efforts and hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able to reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the international community. In the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive movement following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two parties honour their commitments under the accord and create conditions for the establishment of good- neighbourly relations and cooperation. Similarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding the resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through the implementation of the United Nations peace plan. Angola is following with particular attention the situation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and supports the efforts of the Government of that country to find a just and fair solution to the land problem that was inherited from the colonial period. In this context, we share and fully support the position expressed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land reform in Zimbabwe. In the Middle East, the question of Palestine constitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the region. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The resolution of this conflict must encompass a political compromise between the parties involved and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and other understandings reached. Less than a year ago, the people of East Timor finally succeeded in exercising their right to self- determination. Angola feels pleased and compensated by this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the countries that fought in the United Nations and other international forums for the right of the Timorese people to freely choose their own destiny. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, which is responsible for the management of the transition period, cannot permit the current climate of violence, provoked by the militias with the objective of impeding the independence of the territory, to impose itself over the will of a people that has already suffered for decades the scourge of colonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly condemns these acts of violence, which have resulted in great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola appeals to the Security Council to take appropriate steps to ensure its immediate cessation. In the past two years, the world economy has registered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook Asia. The industrial economies and the so-called emerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving considerable rates of growth. However, the present world economic order continues to be marked by sharp distortions between North and South. While the North enjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues to suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to these ills are restrictive economic measures imposed unilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one example  its principal victims are the most vulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to support the lifting of the embargo. The international goal of reducing by one half, by the year 2015, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts, above all by the wealthiest countries and international financial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary to relieve the burden of external debt, whose service payments alone absorb a large part of the financial resources of developing countries. At the same time, steps will be necessary to attenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite the fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community in international economic relations, globalization has benefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped countries. The structural adjustment programmes under way in many developing countries should take account of real necessities and specifics, because many of the measures imposed by the international financial institutions have caused serious difficulties, above all of a social nature. To conclude my remarks, I would like to call attention to the need to pay more attention to the economic situation of the African continent. This should be done in such a way as to facilitate its integration into the world market, particularly through the transfer of technology and increasing productive investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n3 Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, and to express my strong conviction that, under your guidance, the work of this session will be conducted successfully. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the work carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and for his competent guidance of the previous session. At the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a sovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to making its modest contribution, in the activities of the community of countries Members of the United Nations, to greater peace, stability, security and economic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating internal political and economic stability, as well as by pursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving constructive cooperation with the countries of South- Eastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session, Albania has been taking further steps towards consolidating its democratic institutions and constitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its economy and consolidating and ensuring respect for human rights. Because of the efficient measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to the help provided by our partners, Albania is recovering from the consequences of last year's conflict in Kosovo. Albania has become an open and safe country for foreign investment. The policies of the Albanian Government to privatize strategic sectors and absorb foreign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of security and public order, as well as the fight against organized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that are appreciated not only within my country, but elsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the establishment of the office of Ombudsman have further raised the level of protection of and respect for human rights in Albania. Albania is currently on the eve of local elections, which will be of fundamental importance for the future development of the country  not because of the results so much as because of the way in which the elections will be conducted. For this reason, the Albanian Government, in close cooperation with specialized international institutions, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Development Programme and others, has made every effort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and democratic. Albania has clearly expressed its intention to play a primary and constructive role in the common attempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and stable region, clearly aiming at European integration. The policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a requirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent expression of goodwill and mutual interest in the 8  protection of democratic institutions, fundamental freedoms, stability and prosperity in the region. Consequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded towards the creation of stable relations of mutual cooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to be a primary strategy for future European integration. Relations with these countries have been institutionalized not only bilaterally, but also multilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these relations common economic, political and security interests, as well as respect for human freedoms and rights, including those of national minorities living in the territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to make inter-Balkan relations follow the model of existing relations among European Union member countries, with the free movement of people, goods and capital. More than a year after the bloody conflict in Kosovo that endangered peace and stability in the region, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that the situation in Kosovo has improved significantly since the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the United Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by the war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the economy and of the common administration institutions has begun and the political situation and order in the country have improved significantly. The current situation in Kosovo contradicts the sceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and there, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against the establishment of the United Nations administration there. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a year ago will not fade, but will make us more conscious of the catastrophic consequences that the chauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to an innocent civilian population. In order to make a contribution to the founding of a democratic society in Kosovo in which human and national rights are fully respected, we have established very close relations with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their representatives. Albanians, even more than other people in the region, wish for and will welcome the democratization of Serbia, because, historically, they have suffered more than others from Serbian nationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up with reality, and we have to be realistic. Following very attentively the preparations for local elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government expresses its conviction that the political forces in Kosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in accordance with democratic principles and values, without acts of political violence. We would also like to express our sincere will for the full participation of the Serb community and of the other minorities in Kosovo in this electoral process because, as we have previously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and multicultural Kosovo. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the entire international community to apply stronger pressure against the Milosević regime in order to force him to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners and hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help bring the criminals who caused the massacres against the Kosovar population before the United Nations Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to strengthen the international police presence and to work on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect any kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it. I would also like to reiterate that the realization of United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the promises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar economy is of special importance. It should be included in regional cooperation projects, especially in the framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Although the Balkan political scenery has changed, and the countries of the region are engaged in a process of cooperation, there still exists a source of tension and conflict in the region, a source that has consequences for the countries of the region and beyond. It is Milosević's regime. He was not satisfied by the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he personally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is destroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining Yugoslavia. Next week, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Serbia. The current situation there indicates that very little chance exists for them to be free and fair. The recent amendments to the Yugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the opposition and the student movement and the 9  censorship and closing down of independent media are explicit facts proving that Milosević may transform these elections into a tool for illegally maintaining power. Like all the rest of the international community, the Albanian Government looks forward to genuine democratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces that possess new visions for the future of their country and of the whole region. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for the positive developments in Kosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to stabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic institutions there. As a neighbouring country, Albania closely follows developments in Montenegro. It condemns Milosević's attempts to destabilize that Republic and to undermine the democratic and integrative processes that are being undertaken by the legitimate Montenegrin leadership. Following the good- neighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the Albanian Government has recently developed intensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current relations have reached the highest level ever known, having been extended to areas of mutual interest, such as political, economic and trade cooperation, the free movement of people and so forth. It is our intention to further extend and strengthen these relations in the future. The countries in our region are involved in an already irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration. Not only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now aware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe, of the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is not integrated into the European Union. The regional conflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to understand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not only in the interest of its countries, but also in the interest of the European Union itself. An economically developed and democratically consolidated Balkans cannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The European integration of the Balkans and its development consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no importance whether a country tries to protect its democratic institutions, laws, public order or respect human rights; it can never attain the desired success if it is not economically developed. We are conscious that European integration is not an easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and difficult path. Before being integrated into the European Union, all the countries of our region should first be integrated among themselves, and existing societies in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect the best features of European civilization. In order to achieve this, we should first combat and overcome extreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and policies, because Europeanization means cooperation, tolerance and integration. The end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a turning point for the future of the Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best response to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like the European Union member countries, consider this initiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration of South-Eastern Europe into the European structures. The Albanian Government regards the implementation of the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities. Albania is highly appreciated by its international partners for the engagement and the responsibility it has shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the Stability Pact projects. We hope that the strong political will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end of the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by the will to finalize financial support for the rapid implementation of the Stability Pact projects. Albania's achievements in its domestic and foreign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its further integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The Albanian people have a clear European orientation, and that is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10 years have enjoyed their total support for their European integration policy. The present Albanian Government, representing and expressing the will of the people, has continuously fulfilled all the required conditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a higher level of relations with the European Union. We hope that in the near future the institutions of the European Union will approve the status report that the Albanian Government presented at Brussels several months ago. This approval will pave the way for the beginning of negotiations to reach Albania's association and stability agreement with the European Union. Albania's acceptance in the World Trade Organization in July this year was also an encouraging and very optimistic event in this respect. 10  The Albanian Government has welcomed the initiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of the European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in November this year. It is another affirmation of common efforts to further advance the democratization and integration processes in the region and the consolidation of security and stability there. The new century has started. We should keep on facing old problems, along with our new challenges. Some of those may be local crises, organized crime, traffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so forth, all of which require practical and well-oriented cooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of the world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia and so forth, made the role of such organizations as the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the other hand, the world has entered the era of globalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is unavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring negative consequences, especially to small and poor countries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is necessary to compile and to implement global strategies, and the United Nations can easily do that. Only a week has passed since one of the most distinguished events for the international community, the Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all the leaders of the world, where they affirmed their goodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the new millennium and in strengthening the United Nations. The Albanian Government hails the results of the Summit and expresses its conviction that all United Nations Member countries should unite all their forces for the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the final Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report: We must do more than talk about our future, however. We must start to create it. (A/54/2000, para. 17) It is time to take concrete steps in this direction.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n4 Andorra will become, through the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) rotation scheme, a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations at the beginning of 2001, for a period of three years. This is a great responsibility and a particular challenge for a small country that has only been a Member of the United Nations since 1993. My Minister of External Relations, Mr. Albert Pintat, would have loved to have been here today to express to Members Andorra's commitment to the goals of the United Nations and specially our obligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised the Brahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeeping operations, which my country supports. When he learned that he would be unable to lead this year's delegation to the United Nations, owing to unavoidable official functions in Europe, he asked me, in the light of our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC, to contribute to this general debate of the year 2000 with some free reflections — if possible innovative ones — on what globalization might mean for a small State. This is a daunting task since everything seems to have been said about the subject, but I shall try to dutifully carry out my Minister's instructions. First, however, let me convey to President Harri Holkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his election as President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, while thanking his predecessor, Theo-Ben Gurirab, for a difficult job well done. When I was a student here in the United States many years ago, I took a course in photography. I had taken from my family's house in Andorra a negative — it was one of the older glass negatives — and there in the university photography lab I set it up for developing. I remember that moment when I peered into the developer tray and saw, slowly forming on the white photographic paper, an image, the image of my great grandmother. It was a shock, there in New Haven, to see this face from a long distant past, from long before I was born, come slowly into clarity. A lost image from a lost past. If I had the time, and Members the inclination, I could tell them about my great-grandmother, a formidable woman who never left the Valley of Andorra, high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. I could tell them what her face, strong and hard as the stone of the mountains, says about the history of my country. In the photograph, she is dressed all in black, and looks away from the camera, down at the rocky ground. Behind her, one can see the stones of the 16  family farm, high up in the mountains above Saint Julia, one of the seven parishes that make up the Principality of Andorra. Her Andorra is very different from the country today. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone- strewn fields are now covered with shops, houses and hotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that are the pride of my country, churches that date back to the foundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth century and that loomed over the villages for almost a millennium, are now hemmed in by concrete buildings — stores, apartments, houses, the same buildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Beijing or New York. Yes, so much has changed since my grandfather's hand snapped this picture. My great-grandmother would recognize only the church towers and the stones of the mountains. And what was so specific about her world — the stories, the cooking, the fabric of daily life — well, that has disappeared. In the space of 70 years, Andorra has changed from being a poor and remote place to a prosperous country, with over 10 million tourists a year, who come for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. We are now a commercial hub. If you look for a country transformed by globalization, you might look to Andorra. Andorra is a country that has survived, independent and uninvaded, since 1278. It is one of the oldest and one of the smallest democracies in the world. A historian might argue that this remarkable fact is due to its isolation and poverty, or because for centuries the outside world was neatly balanced by its co-Princes — the Bishop of Urgell to the south, and to the north the Count of Foix, later the French King and since 1805 the head of the French State. Unsurprisingly, I might attribute the remarkable record of peace to the cautious character of the Andorran people. Or rather — and less partially — I think that because it is a small country, where parishes have been able to readily communicate with one another at the Casa de la Vall, the House of the Valleys, communication never broke down. The Millennium Summit of the United Nations had as its theme globalization. As a summit, it was aptly named, since I would say that globalization is the story of the second millennium — indeed perhaps it is the story of human culture. I am a politician, not a historian, but we all know the effect on both Europe and the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, or the transformation of indigenous and European cultures brought about by the “discovery” of the New World, or the effect of the slave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on both Africa and the Americas. These violent encounters formed the world even as they brought death and destruction. They also sparked our imaginations. The Globe was the name of Shakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London, a joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like to think of the United Nations as the new Globe, a theatre in which we are the players or — if we have the imagination — the dramatists for the story of our fragile planet. But the globalization we are now facing is of a different nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in his opening introduction to the Millennium conference, the starting point for this millennium can be summed up in one word: “globalization” — the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village. It is an idyllic view, the view of the world as a village. Of course, the Secretary-General is all too aware of the negative effects of the process. In the same introduction, he cautions: “Globalization offers great opportunities, but at present its benefits are very unevenly distributed while its costs are borne by all. “Thus the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people.” (A/54/2000, paras. 13 and 14) We all know the protests that have taken place, and will take place, against this same word, “globalization”. Let us listen, for instance, to one of the interested groups, chosen at random, the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), which understands the term as referring to a “globalized economic system dominated by supranational corporate trade and banking institutions that are not accountable to democratic processes or national Governments”. The IFG accuses “the GATT, WTO, Maastricht, NAFTA, combined with structural adjustment policies of the IMF and the World Bank, to be direct stimulants to the 17  processes that weaken democracy, create a world order that is under the control of transnational corporations, and that devastate the natural world”. According to the IFG, globalization brings the diminishment of powers of local and indigenous communities, States and even nations, destroys both small-scale agriculture and the earth's remaining wilderness, and brings a worldwide homogenization of diverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter its effects, the IFG advocates the revitalization of local communities by promoting maximum self-reliance, the recognition of rights of indigenous peoples and the abandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economic growth. When I listen to these words, I cannot help but hear a lament, a lament for a lost and simpler world: the world of my great-grandmother. And I am reminded of that greatest of all laments for lost culture, the work that indeed informs the thinking behind the activists who struggle against the forces of globalization — Claude Lévi-Strauss and his masterpiece, Tristes Tropiques, his elegy for the people of the Amazon basin, which even as he captured it on paper was disappearing into our modern world. I understand the sadness for the lost world, the world of the past that is always slipping away from us, that exists in the black-and-white negative of our memory. And so here I elegize, before this Assembly, all that has disappeared, not simply in Andorra but in the world, all that has been forgotten, paved over by the forces of travel, of tourism, of telephone, television, cinema and the Internet. These technologies link the world; they narrow its distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of the globe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listeners now: what new discoveries await us? We cannot imagine them, but they will come, and sooner than we think, in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours. And yet, and yet ... The IFG manifesto was not posted on a church door in Wittenburg, printed in a new technology that sparked another revolution, the Reformation of the sixteenth century. No, it was downloaded from a web site on the Internet. This Web — in which ideas, images, voices travel across our globe in a flash — is a remarkable invention that collapses both time and space. In the same way, I now realize that my image of my great-grandmother came from a negative, from a camera — a technology that perhaps more than any other, besides the computer, has transformed and quickened the pace of our world. This is to make a very simple point: not simply that this manifesto is presented in the very technology of globalization, but that nostalgia for a local economy might be a product of globalization itself. My great-grandmother had a good life, but a hard one, with terrible cold in the winter and constant work. Would she have chosen this life, if she could have had another? If she had known another? And more to the point, would she have been allowed to choose? We need to remember that people themselves have embraced change. Real people who are not content to live — physically or imaginatively — in their places of birth, but, filled with a desire to better their lives or to see the world, they reach out and try to grasp change, if only to know what they have lost. Lévi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognize that people he observed, deep in the Amazon rain forests, might want to leave their paradise — not because they were driven out by modernity, the modernity that Lévi-Strauss himself made so much of, but because they wanted to better their lives, to embrace the world, to feel for themselves the painful pulse of gain and loss. We need only leave this Hall and walk through any street in the city to recognize this. People from all across the world, people of all races, walking up and down, alone or in conversation, happy or unhappy, homesick or embracing the dreams this city seems to proffer. In the streets, we see restaurants that offer wonderful meals from all around the world, and fusion restaurants: French-Senegalese, American-Thai. Or fusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris or Hong Kong or Andorra la Vella, the people are changing, colours are shifting. What brave new world is being born around us? In saying this, I do not want to contradict the concerns of the anti-globalists, to in any way deny their recognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at our peril practical questions that turn around international finance, international corporations, the widening gulf between have and have-not countries, the dangers to the environment. 18  These are practical matters to be seen to. To paraphrase Annan, we need mechanisms to equalize the benefits of globalization, to make life a positive thing for all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest for superfluous material goods, but shelter and health and protection from disease. And I would add, simply, that before and during my tenure here as Ambassador, the United Nations hosted a series of summits or conferences designed to address these very problems — Rio, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Beijing, Rome, just to name a few. The world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the world summit for children and Rio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body of work in place to address the stresses of globalization. What we need to do now is continue to work towards our goals. In conclusion, I would like to consider a presupposition of both global optimists and pessimists: the notion that globalization has replaced nationalism. Again, to quote Kofi Annan, globalization means “the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village”. Similarly, the report published in The New York Times concerning the protests against globalization stated that “speakers do not oppose globalization per se, because, in their view, the era of nation-States is coming to its inevitable end”. Are globalization and nationalism opposed? On the surface, they would appear to be. So much of globalization — economies that transcend borders, communication networks that shrink the world — seems to render an earlier model of the nation-State obsolete. And yet, whether it be the ethnic conflicts in Rwanda or in the Balkans, issues of immigration in the developed world or conflict in East Timor, we know that the question of the border, of the passport, remains increasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness, nationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of a nationalism no longer linked to true patriotism, that is to the love of a place. I pray that the world does not succumb to an unthinking nationalism that would exist simply to exclude or to feed the ambitions of unscrupulous politicians. We need a democratic nationalism forged out of a concern for the rights of individuals. That is not nationalism as it worked out from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries — a nationalism linked to the struggle to control markets, to the scramble for loot — but a new nationalism that is not predicated on identity, on cultural sameness, a nationalism that is linked to a world economy that is no longer restricted by national borders, a democratic or civic nationalism, a global nationalism. This would be a new nationalism, I must add, in which Andorra and other small countries are not historical anachronisms, but are emblematic of this civic nationalism, predicated as it must be on the democratic will of the people. In this sense, Andorra's quiet patriotism, its 700 years of peace and communication, can modestly serve as a kind of historical model. Countries need to rethink what it means to be a nation in order to participate effectively in the life of this our globe, in order to become what we must be and to a certain extent already are: united nations. In its very name, in its very mission, the United Nations anticipated the globalization that is so rapidly occurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war and later by nuclear war, forged from the most terrible of national struggles, the United Nations is an activist forum for issues that are global, not in the sense that they transcend any individual nation, but in the sense that they are of concern to all nations. The International Criminal Court, whose statute will soon be ratified by Andorra, a country which had the honour of contributing to it by composing the first paragraphs of the preamble, is a good example of an entity that respects borders but that places human rights above all. Crimes against humanity must be punished, and shall be. This new nationalism, while it recognizes borders, asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty and peace are primary. Hence, the United Nations, even as it respects national borders, needs to recognize that it can and should become proactive in the protection of those rights in the case of civil conflict. So too, the great global threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases demands a response from each nation and a recognition that these threats can never be adequately dealt with alone, but only by working globally through the United Nations. In short, we need not only the United Nations, but, as many have said, we need united nations. 19  I began this speech with the image of my great- grandmother looking down at the stony ground of her country. I would end it, symbolically at least, with another image: our image. Someday, our great- grandchildren may discover our image, perhaps even our image here in this place. Perhaps they will reproduce it through a technology so strange, so remarkable, we cannot even imagine it. But let us hope that they live in the brave new world I have spoken of today. And let us hope that they see us as an image of positive change. We who have lived through such change cannot turn away from it. With our feet on the ground of this great globe of ours, we need to look forward. We need to grasp change. We need to reach out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n5 I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere congratulations and regards on your election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of this session's proceedings. We also thank your predecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which 16  he directed the work of the previous session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for the efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. The convening of the Millennium Summit a few days ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment of the political will of the leaders of the world to deal effectively with the problems and challenges that face the international community, such as the proliferation of proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing poverty and debt, as well as other attendant transnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime, international terrorism, environmental pollution, persistent violations of human rights and the disparities resulting from globalization and information technology. The consequences of these prevailing conditions have, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness of the importance of adhering to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of consolidating the rule of international law through the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the principle of equality and the right to self- determination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of cooperation and tolerance among the different cultures, beliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for achieving the desired security, stability and human development. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome of the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Yemen, as an important political and historic event that will promote confidence-building measures and good neighbourly relations. At the same time, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow the example of those fraternal States and to respond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either entering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran's occupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice. In this context, we would like to reaffirm that all actions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic Republic of Iran on those three islands and its continued construction of military and civilian installations on them, are illegal measures considered null and void, and do not establish or entail any legal rights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In fact, they represent a violation of the territorial sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and contravene the principles and purposes of the Charters of both the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian peaceful intentions in the region. More than a year has elapsed since the Gulf Cooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial Committee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, with developing a mechanism for direct negotiations between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of the endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the reinforcement of the foundations of peace and security in the Arab Gulf region. Despite the fact that almost ten years have elapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab Gulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of that War. Consequently, it is imperative that political and diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a peaceful solution that would lead to ending the human suffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we invite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely fulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to the release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of war or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti property, in implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard, we would like to underline the importance of respecting the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as refraining from the threat or use of force, in order to ensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the region. The Middle East peace process recently witnessed important developments during which major efforts were exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable and fair solutions based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible and constructive proposals put forward by the Palestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the Israeli Government persisted in its positions of procrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to 17  abide by the agreements it had concluded with the Palestinian side. Thus, in affirming our position of solidarity with the fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership, represented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our call to the co-sponsors of the peace process — in particular the United States of America — and the other active States to continue exerting political and diplomatic efforts that support and promote negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, with the aim of finding a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this settlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al- Sharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Also in this context we reaffirm our unceasing support of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to regain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967. We call on the international community to demand that Israel resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the interest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all the States and peoples of the region. The United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once again fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory, expresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete the extension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil. In the same vein, we support the demands of sisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on it be lifted, particularly since it has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions. We also express our satisfaction at the outcome of the recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti and invite all Somali factions to reinforce national unity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and sustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the region of the Horn of Africa. The growing number of problems resulting from the continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing in some parts of the African continent, the Balkans, South Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of constant concern for the international community. Consequently, we support all regional and international efforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful means, and we emphasize that just and lasting resolution of these issues cannot be attained until the parties concerned demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate their commitment to implement relevant Security Council resolutions. Despite international unanimity, shown in the Disarmament Conference and other international forums, regarding the need to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a matter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned at this time as some States are striving to outdo each other in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in particular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a means of settling their territorial disputes. Since such actions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic security balance, at both the regional and international levels, we call upon the States concerned to review their policies in this respect and to promote the establishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean. We also urge the international community to demand once again that the Israeli Government accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and agree to subject its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Despite the multidimensional changes that the world economy is witnessing as a result of the deregulation of markets, globalization and modern technology, the economic and social gap between the developed and developing States still exists and is growing — thereby exacerbating poverty and unemployment, environmental degradation and debt accumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium Summit and the Summit's Declaration highlight the great importance our countries attach to these issues. This makes it incumbent on all of us to work assiduously on carrying out the commitments and undertakings contained therein regarding the creation of an environment favourable to development, elimination of poverty and free access for the exports of the least developed countries to the markets of industrialized countries. I confirm the determination of the United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to 18  work towards narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. The United Arab Emirates continues its sustained efforts in support of economic- and social-development projects in many countries of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, be it through direct participation in financing such projects or by supporting international and regional efforts to attain those goals. Finally, the ever-increasing burden of economic, social and human development, which is the first safeguard of the political stability that we desire, demands that mechanisms for regional and international cooperation, foremost among which is the United Nations, be created. Hence, we call for continued efforts to carry out the structural reform and development of the world Organization, in particular the Security Council and the General Assembly, so that the Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes in international relations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n6 In this, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to emphasize the great friendship that unites the Argentine Republic and Finland. I also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to Argentina, for the constructive way in which he presided over the Assembly's work at the last session. We also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon its entry into the United Nations and extend our friendship and cooperation to its people. This debate is taking place after a very productive exchange of opinions at the highest level during the Millennium Summit, which we hope will mark, together with the final Declaration, the beginning of a new era leading to a more equitable world and a more effective Organization, in accordance with objectives set out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled “We the peoples”. For my country, this is also an opportunity to set out before the General Assembly the principles and objectives of our foreign policy. The Government of President Fernando de la Rúa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has drafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it received from the Argentine people. This policy aims at strengthening our integration with neighbouring countries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and promoting economic development, social progress, free trade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction. Argentina is determined to participate on the international scene jointly to build a peaceful and stable world based on the values of representative democracy, the rule of law, the protection and promotion of human rights, respect for the environment, economic liberalization, social progress, international cooperation and the maintenance of international peace and security, pursuant to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was stated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are shared by the vast majority of Members of this Organization. On the basis of its ongoing interests, the Government has set as a priority objective its political and economic integration with the other States members of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) — Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have agreed with these countries to consolidate MERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to promote greater integration on the basis of balance and equity. We have made significant progress towards the expansion of our markets since the signing of the Treaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of the determination of the member countries to implement an open trade policy in their economic programmes. 25  The creation of MERCOSUR was a political decision transcending the economic sphere. MERCOSUR provides a political forum within which trust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in all areas foster the increasing complementarity and convergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have bound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate members in the context of the Free Trade Area and we trust that they will become full members in the near future. As a consequence of the broadening political and economic dimensions of our integration project, we are also witnessing the convergence of approaches to defence and security in our region. This contributes to a continental perspective based on confidence and cooperation. We and our neighbours have made progress towards the creation of the joint MERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace. Argentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America reflecting the peaceful and cooperative security necessary to harmonious development. At the same time, as a member of the Rio Group, which has now grown to include Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its high-level political consultations and cooperation in order to maintain peace, strengthen representative democracy and promote sustainable development in the region. It is our firm intention that our countries shall enjoy greater participation in the global economy. At the recent summit convened in Brasilia to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American countries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and harmony that marks its relations on the basis of these principles and objectives. The consolidation of democratic stability in Latin America continues to be a central policy of the Argentine Government. We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of others and we respect international law. We promote the consolidation of democratic processes on the basis of our deep conviction that free, regular and transparent elections and a plurality of political parties are essential instruments for affirming and guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy. My country also reaffirms its commitment to eradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and to ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region. We shall continue to pursue our joint action in the regional and global campaign against drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and organized crime. The Argentine Republic has a natural interest in the South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin American countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting held in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action was adopted to implement our shared objectives in the peaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation, development, the conservation of fishery resources, the fight against drug trafficking and the protection of the environment. My country is in favour of free trade in order to achieve development and the eradication of poverty. The Argentine Government believes that protectionism not only generates the deflection of trade and the closure of markets, but also constitutes a form of discrimination. Argentina urges the entire international community to commit itself seriously to eliminating distortions of trade and will continue to fight for these objectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is being made in negotiations on the free trade agreement of the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area by the year 2005. In the World Trade Organization, our country has provided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new round to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in agriculture. Argentina also continues to support negotiations to develop political and economic association between MERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in this framework, the gradual liberalization of agricultural trade and services. We are constantly seeking new ways to integrate ourselves with the world. The realities of technological change and continual innovation require developing countries to adapt to a scheme of international economic integration based on a new paradigm of production. The challenge is to ensure the access of the least developed countries to this process of constant technological change and innovation. There can be no doubt that the international community — in particular the United Nations — must cooperate to promote the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that 26  technological innovations reach those countries with fewer resources. In his report “We the peoples”, the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this task. Without the adequate dissemination of and access to the new technologies of the digital revolution, we will see the gap between rich and poor widen. Individual States and the international community as a whole must therefore find solutions that guarantee greater fairness in the use of digital information. Argentina remains fully committed to the international community's efforts to protect the environment from the negative impact of human activities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to the principles of sustainable development agreed upon in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development — principles that were reflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment and in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the importance of making adequate preparation — during this very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for the conference to be held in 2002 to review the implementation of Agenda 21. Moreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate the international legal regimes in the field of environmental protection. In this context, and bearing in mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric warming on the global ecosystem and on human life, we attach special importance to the entry into force, as soon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The twenty-first century was preceded by a prolonged strategic and ideological confrontation, which has given way to a moment in history in which representative democracy, human rights and open economies are shared values. At the same time, we are facing a more complex world that has yet to engender a stable international order. The explosion of serious intra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkans or in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a new stage in conflicts — a stage in which, regrettably, conflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious differences. The Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute to achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing and neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the development of nations. We believe that if this consensus were based on greater democratization in international relations this would increase the efficacy and the functioning of the international system. Since it is impossible for individual States to face these threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative security policies to eliminate the potential risk of conflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of legal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united fashion the immediate and underlying causes of conflicts, which often arise because of the lack of economic opportunities and because of social inequalities. The Members of the United Nations face the challenge of finding a response to questions raised by recent international crises, including the international humanitarian crises. My country believes that the principle of non-intervention must be duly respected because it is the pillar underpinning relations between independent States. At the same time, we cannot conceal our concern at the explosion of violence against ethnic, racial or religious minorities. In particular we are concerned about the situation of vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally displaced persons, and about the situation of children in armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the international community cannot remain indifferent and must provide an adequate response to humanitarian crises. We must emphasize the role that can be played by international tribunals to create awareness that impunity will not be tolerated. The International Criminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been created, constitute important instruments of deterrence. In addition to the internal reforms that the Secretary-General has initiated with singular success within his sphere of competence, the United Nations must give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main and subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be done in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and effectively with which solutions are found to the daily problems facing the Organization. Maintenance of international peace and security is a primary responsibility of the Security Council, which must be strengthened. If these responsibilities are not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United 27  Nations can be carried out with any certainty of success. Since the inception of multilateral diplomacy, Argentina has defended the principle of the sovereign equality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our country maintains that the reform of the Security Council must be arrived at via consensus, and this consensus must not entail new discrimination, privileges or exclusions. The vast majority of the international community — seeking to ensure respect for the values of democracy and universality — believes that a new Security Council will have to allow for greater participation by all. This cannot be achieved if new permanent seats — like those established in 1945 — are established. Reform of the Council must allow all States a greater opportunity to participate in the Council, which must not be monopolized by only a few countries. For this reason, Argentina supports exclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictions on the right of the veto, without losing sight of the ultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We support the adoption of rules of procedure that guarantee transparency and the possibility of the participation of all Member States in this organ. Our support for the peaceful settlement of disputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our foreign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated the Argentine commitment to continue participating in peacekeeping operations established by the Security Council. The most recent conflicts have shown how important efficient training of the forces participating in these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina in 42 years of participating in these missions is reflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre for training for peacekeeping operations. It has been operating since 1995, with the participation of personnel from other Member States. We also established the centre for training of security forces for foreign missions. Argentina, which is currently involved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the disposal of the United Nations its military and police training centres. We also support the initiatives to strengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the Organization, and we would support restructuring efforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support for peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and in the field. My country was pleased to receive the conclusions and recommendations recently issued by the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and contained in the Brahimi report. These provide a valuable basis for building international consensus aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization to prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish peace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the Special Committee for Peacekeeping Operations, supports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a detailed analysis of the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report — including its possible financial implications — with a view to achieving its early implementation. My Government is particularly concerned about the problems related to the security and protection of those who participate in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions. The personnel of the United Nations and associated personnel, as well as the personnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian assistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as we have seen recently in the tragic events that have occurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina, which is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged an improvement in the security situation of United Nations personnel via the adoption of practical and legal measures, including financial-planning and implementation measures for these operations. In this context we should also reiterate the duty of the international community to provide assistance to those countries facing emergency situations, which arise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed conflicts. In this area a significant role can be played by the “White Helmets” initiative, which involves the establishment of bodies of specialized volunteers organized by the Members of the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are victims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the serious problems that affect these people. We should also mention the issue of AIDS which particularly affects the poorest areas of the world. More than 34 million people suffer from this illness today. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular, more than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan Africa. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The illness and death of so many workers is draining already weakened economies. The impact of this phenomenon on the future of the affected regions will 28  probably mean greater marginalization and will undermine the foundations of stability, security and peace. The international community and this Organization and its specialized agencies must contribute urgently all available resources to the fight against this disease. I would like to refer in particular to the sovereignty dispute between my country and the United Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the surrounding seas. The recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty over this part of our national territory, respecting the interests of the inhabitants and international law, is a precept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina. This item is on the agenda of the Organization, which in numerous resolutions has requested the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to renew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution to the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833. Today, in accordance with that request, Argentina reiterates once again its complete willingness to renew bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to resolve this question. We reiterate our support for the mission of good offices with which the General Assembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the parties in achieving this objective. The world stage in the post-cold-war era is the scene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal traffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we are seeing the unprecedented spread of representative democracy and economic and technological modernization. Against this backdrop, our main task is to reach agreements that will enable us to face these challenges and seize these opportunities in the best way possible. Equipping the United Nations for the challenges of the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All Member States must undertake to fulfil this commitment if our efforts are to be crowned with success. Argentina is committed to this task and will continue making its contribution. On 31 December next, my country will end its term as a member of the Security Council. During its two-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to contribute constructively to decision-making and consensus-building on all items on the Council's agenda. On the basis of our potential and bearing in mind the features of the current international situation, Argentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to continue to play an active part in the consolidation of peace and international security and in the development of peoples.","application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"data":[{"index":"1","year":2000,"session":55,"country":"AFG","speech":"On my way to the Assembly Hall, I was informed by the Supreme State Council of the Islamic State of Afghanistan that in a self-evident act of aggression hundreds of Pakistani military personnel — army, plain-clothes personnel and armed Taliban — are reported to have been positioned in the Shah Salim pass dividing the Pakistan border town of Chitral from north-eastern Afghanistan, bound for an attack on Badakhshan province. On behalf of my delegation, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the major task of presiding over the important millennium session of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, on his excellent leadership of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, which set the stage for the Millennium Summit. Three years ago, I stood before the Assembly and stated from this very rostrum that, as the crisis in Afghanistan continued to unfold, we had to ask, and answer, important questions. At the time, I spoke of the dark and ominous movement known as the Taliban, which, backed by cross-border troops, had invaded Afghanistan. This year, at its millennium session, the General Assembly indeed has to answer major questions. One among many is the silence the world has chosen to keep in dealing with the Taliban and their Pakistani supporters. With the spread of Talibanism, which has led to the abject misery of the Afghan nation, massive insurgency and turmoil in the region and beyond, is it not high time that the international community put a stop to the Pakistani-operated Taliban processing machine? Certainly, mere rhetoric and inadequate reactions are not enough. It is with this view that I should like to focus my statement entirely on the situation in Afghanistan and its devastating regional and international implications, within the given time limit. 4 A question arises: what has been the result of the Talibanization of the occupied parts of Afghanistan? In an age of information and globalization, it has been a reign of terror imposed by a religious police, abuse in the name of religion, the elimination of all freedoms and civil liberties, massive violations of human rights, degrading and tormenting treatment of men and women, trafficking of women and girls, the forced separation of women from their menfolk, the random and deliberate round-up of individuals based on their ethnic and religious origins, the practice of scorchedearth policy, the torching and total obliteration of farmlands, orchards and other means of livelihood, the contamination of water resources, the forcible dispatch of children and adults to the battlefields, the removal of all but rudimentary religious education — for male students only — with the closure of all schools for females, the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid, the intensification of battles, an exacerbation of the situation, widespread terrorism and the destruction of the historical heritage and artefacts of Afghanistan in order to alienate the Afghan nation from its ancestry and historical identity. The objective of the Pakistani military intelligence establishment, known as Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), through the imposition of the socalled Islamic Emirate of the Taliban, has been to create instability in Central and South Asia by means of terrorism. This “Islamic Emirate” has instituted Mullah Omar, the militia's leader, as the undisputed Amir-ul-Mo'mineen, meaning “Commander of the faithful” not only in Afghanistan, but in theory throughout the Muslim world. The process the Pakistani military intelligence has chosen for the realization of its objective is to transform the Afghan nation into an exhausted, devastated, illiterate, ignorant and destitute nation struggling hard for mere survival. Pakistan wants to turn Afghanistan into its false front to mask illicit activities of narcotics trafficking, terrorism and other crimes, as well as religious extremism, by establishing centres and bases for such activities. Attempting to act as the champion of the Muslim world, Pakistan continues to carry out these activities under the name of Islam. It is therefore not a matter of astonishment that such activities have led to the defamation of both the noble religion of Islam and the image of Muslims throughout the world. In short, the Afghan nation has become the direct victim of the diabolic dreams of the Pakistani military's hegemonic interests in the region. These diabolic dreams are pursued by the Pakistani military intelligence, ISI, an evil and extremist institution, while the implied risk and perilous consequences for the very survival of Pakistan as a State in the future are overlooked. As the world is gradually awakening to the creeping Taliban threat, it is a matter of dismay that some “civilized” nations, on certain occasions, have preferred to deal with the reclusive and defiant Taliban, an entity which has failed to meet the minimum standard of being considered civilized, while having championed terrorism, human rights violations and crimes against humanity. It is no surprise that only Pakistan's military junta has continuously given its full blessing to the movement. At least until early May of this year, the official position of Pakistan, from what its diplomats and officials strangely claimed, was that it maintained contacts with both parties to the conflict. However, Pakistan's News Network International (NNI) news agency reported on 25 May 2000 that General Pervez Musharraf claimed that Pakistan's pro-Taliban policy was “in accordance with Pakistan's national interest.” Advocating that Pashtoons should be on the side of Pakistan, the General was quoted as saying, “We have a national security interest, both demographic and geographic.” He further stated that in the realization of this security interest, “Pashtoons should be on our side and they”, meaning Pashtoons, “are represented by Taliban.” The world must know that in a flagrant violation of recognized international norms and principles and in clear contempt of the United Nations Charter, the ruler of the Pakistani military junta, under the outrageous pretext of national security interest, has claimed the right to impose a certain ethnic group through the invocation of an ethnically provocative mandate at the cost of the sovereignty and political independence of Afghanistan, a Member of the United Nations and, prior to that, of the League of Nations, long before Pakistan was even born. It is important to remember that terrorist training camps operating from the Taliban-held territories of Afghanistan, including those established by the infamous Osama bin Laden, whose dismantling has 5 been repeatedly called for by the United Nations and the entire international community, have been established by Pakistan's military intelligence through the Taliban mercenaries and other extremist networks. They continue to utilize these territories as a ground for training, sheltering, planning and dispatching elements seeking to commit hostile acts against countries of the region and beyond. This is done under the guise of Islam, but, in fact, it is mainly in pursuit of Pakistani hegemonistic objectives directed towards Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics. Recent events and activities by extremist groups in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are manifest examples of the spillover of the Pakistan/Taliban-supported agenda in the region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan believes it is high time that the Security Council, in accordance with relevant resolutions, undertook appropriate enforcement measures against Pakistan, which is the prime source of sponsorship of these activities. The Security Council, in its unanimously adopted resolution 1267 of 15 October 1999, explicitly demanded that the Taliban mercenaries refrain from sheltering, supporting and training terrorists and planning terrorist acts from Afghan soil against other countries and that it extradite to the requesting States those indicted for committing international acts of terrorism. The recent upsurge of terrorist activities in Central Asian countries and beyond, emanating from the Taliban-occupied parts of Afghanistan, requires drastic measures by the Security Council against the militia and its Pakistani supporters. The consideration of the imposition of further targeted sanctions and the expansion of the scope of resolution 1267 (1999), which must include the end of terrorist activities in all forms and manifestations in the Taliban-held parts of Afghanistan, could adequately, among other things, serve the cause of peace and security in the region. Here I would like to welcome the proposal by the Republic of Uzbekistan for convening an international conference, at the earliest possible time, to debate the evil phenomenon of terrorism. In spite of the current devastating drought in Afghanistan — the most severe in 30 years — Afghanistan remains the leading producer of narcotics. The production of illicit drugs, and their trafficking by the Taliban and the politico-military mafia of Pakistan, account for considerable revenue, which is used to finance the prolonged war in Afghanistan. This leads to considerable transnational organized crime, while adding to the number of addicts, both at home and abroad. Among the many deliberate violations and instances of absolute disregard for international humanitarian law and the numerous crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban and their outside supporters in the year 2000, one could mention the following cases: the cold-blooded killing on 11 May of 198 young Uzbek and Hazara men imprisoned as hostages in Taliban jails; the brutal killing on 5 August of the United Nations mine-clearance employees affiliated with the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation; the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian aid that, according to the European Union, in the light of the devastating drought constituted a breach of international humanitarian law; the forced blood-drawing and organ removal of innocent civilians along the Tagab-Nijrab route in August; the forced deportation of the civilian populations of the city of Aibak on 31 July 2000; the closing down in August, as part of the ongoing fouryear campaign by the Taliban to keep women from working, of all bakeries run by the United Nations World Food Programme in which widows were paid to make bread that was then sold at a subsidized price to other widows, who number at least 25,000 in Kabul alone; the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian neighbourhoods at Taloqan on 15 August; and the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the north due to renewed Taliban military onslaughts. We believe that the commission of those heinous crimes by the Taliban militia was largely attributable to the lack of adequate response by the Security Council and the international community to bring to justice the perpetrators and others involved in incidents at Bamyan in 1997, at Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamyan in 1998, in the north of Kabul in 1999, and in the killings of Iranian diplomats, a journalist and the military adviser to the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) in 1998. It is significant to note that the Taliban continue to deprive women of their fundamental rights, including the right to education, which affects over 100,000 female students in Kabul alone. Women are still barred from employment by the Taliban. While the predictable results will speak for themselves, present 6 and future female generations of Afghanistan will be illiterate. The cultural and social impact of that criminal act on the country's future generations will be enormous. Pakistani military intervention in Afghanistan is a fact well known to the international community. The hundreds of Pakistani prisoners captured while fighting alongside the Taliban and now in the custody of the Government; the mortal remains of hundreds of Pakistanis in the battlefields and the documents and identification cards obtained from their pockets; the intercepted radio transmissions; and the massive logistical support and the overt supply of large quantities of military hardware and ammunition, all prove the direct involvement of Pakistani army personnel in Afghanistan. In fact, Brigadier General Rustam of Pakistan's armed forces, who is currently stationed in Afghanistan's Kunduz province, commands the Pakistani-Taliban-bin Laden operations in the north. He has been assisted by two of bin Laden's henchmen, Abu Wara and Hubab. All of them were involved in the recent occupation of Taloqan and in the atrocities committed against the civilian population. It is important to mention that the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs magazine has estimated the total number of Pakistanis having fought in Afghanistan since 1994 to be in excess of 80,000. A breakdown of Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan include the following: Pakistani armed contingents, including units from the North-West Frontier Corps and different commando units, have actively participated in battles on various occasions; Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers involved in the planning and command and control of both intelligence operations and logistical support; ex-commissioned officers in charge of tactical operations, artillery support and logistics; frontier militia units; paramilitary members of extremist terrorist groups affiliated with the ISI, such as the Sipah-e-Sahaaba, the Sepah-e-Tayeba, the Harakat-ul-Ansar and so on; and the so-called volunteers from Pakistani madrassas, or religious schools. Other categories of foreign fighters in Afghanistan include Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda group and its affiliated units from around the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Africa, and extremist groups from Central Asia, South Asia and the Far East. In addition, thousands of Afghan refugees who were educated and trained in Pakistani religious schools are dispatched to the battlefronts of Afghanistan. Finally, there are conscripted and forcibly recruited persons from around Afghanistan who are deployed as canon fodder. In this context, the Islamic State of Afghanistan appeals to the Security Council to mandate the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan to dispatch an investigation team to Afghanistan to verify and report to the Security Council on the presence of Pakistani armed men and Arab fighters who are working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Taliban mercenaries. This would break the silence that has thus far encouraged further Pakistani intervention in Afghanistan. I should like to remind the Assembly that only those Afghans conscripted and forcibly recruited will be immune from prosecution by the Islamic State of Afghanistan for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The rest shall be subject to indictment. One must conclude that the failure of the Jeddah indirect negotiations in particular, and of other peace initiatives at large, derive from the sad reality that peace has no place in the Taliban agenda. While striving for the realization of noble human values and principles — the institution of a democratic system, the observance of human rights, including those of women and girls, civil liberties and elections — the Islamic State of Afghanistan reiterates its firm position to strive to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict and hereby declares its full readiness for the formation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully representative Government through a workable mechanism such as the traditional grand assembly, or loya jirgah, or any other representative forum under the auspices of the United Nations. Meanwhile, as long as Pakistan continues to directly and massively intervene in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan considers the task of defending the territorial integrity, national unity and political independence of Afghanistan its immediate priority. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has high expectations that the United Nations and the international community will exert pressure on Pakistan to immediately cease its intervention in Afghanistan and to withdraw all its military personnel and armed nationals from Afghanistan; that the Security Council will address the question of foreign 7 intervention, the existence of terrorist networks in Afghanistan and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; that the Organization of the Islamic Conference will clarify its view of the Taliban's words and deeds — spoken and carried out in the name of Islam — which we believe distort, and are contrary to, the true spirit of Islam, its tenets and injunctions; that the United Nations Drug Control Programme will assist the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs; that the United Nations and the international community will step up their efforts for an early and peaceful settlement of the Afghan conflict; and that the international community will provide humanitarian assistance to the war-stricken and drought-hit civilian population of Afghanistan. Here I should like to mention that the current drought, the most severe in 30 years, will have tremendous humanitarian repercussions. We remain thankful for the statements made by the heads of delegation at the Millennium Summit and in the General Assembly expressing their legitimate concerns over the dangers emanating from the Pakistani Taliban-occupied territories of Afghanistan. We deeply appreciate and support the indefatigable efforts of Mr. Francesc Vendrell, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA), who has left no stone unturned, and no party to the conflict or countries concerned out of communication, in finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. I should like to conclude by stating that the United Nations cannot embark on the new millennium without appropriately addressing the issues enshrined in its Charter, among others, the question of noninterference. Neither can this international body advocate globalization in its true sense when Talibanization is threatening regional stability in our part of the world. Certainly the Pakistani military junta will remain the prime actor in this dreadful and immense tragedy in Asia. Like many others afflicted with the Taliban plague, we wonder how far the evil threat of Talibanism will spread, how many more souls it will bury and how many new borders it must cross before the conscience of the international community is awakened, not just to consider but to adopt immediate and drastic preventive measures."},{"index":"2","year":2000,"session":55,"country":"AGO","speech":"Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate, in particular, the outgoing President, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the wise and dynamic manner in which he carried out his mandate. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unselfish efforts to make the United Nations an increasingly effective instrument, capable of dealing with the demands of our times and finding and implementing solutions for the most pressing problems of the world. Just a few days ago, during the Millennium Summit, the leaders of the world defined the priorities of the United Nations for the twenty-first century and expressed the need to adapt its structure for the demands and challenges of the future. During that event of transcendental importance for the lives of the people of this planet, the indispensable and irreplaceable character of the United Nations in international relations was reaffirmed. Member States reiterated their promise to maintain and preserve the United Nations as a privileged mechanism for international dialogue and cooperation in the name of peace and well-being of all peoples. Indeed, given the role of the United Nations as guarantor of peace and well-being of the peoples, it is urgent that we begin the implementation of actions aimed at adapting its internal structure to new world realities. This will permit the Organization to deal rapidly and effectively with the main problems of the world and avoid having its members resort to solutions outside the established framework of its main organs  namely, the General Assembly and the Security Council. In recent years, the United Nations sought, through world summits, to find global solutions with broad international consensus for the many misfortunes that afflict humanity, such as local wars, degradation of the environment, violations of human rights and inadequate social development, among others. Various plans of action were outlined. However, the problems 12  they sought to attenuate or resolve persist. Many have even become worse. A revision of the mechanism for implementing decisions is needed, through a revitalization and strengthening of the United Nations system, particularly that of its principal bodies, such as the Security Council. From our point of view, that body requires greater internal democracy, and its composition should reflect the current membership in the Organization and its geographic diversity. We think that, in this way, its decision-making would be faster and its performance in the area of peacekeeping and international security more effective. The persistence of a climate of insecurity and instability in a number of regions of the world cannot be attributed solely to internal causes; it also stems from weakness in the international security system. A reflection of this are the deficiencies that still exist, for example, in the early warning system and in the peacekeeping operations mechanisms. These have not always corresponded to the desired objectives, either because the peacekeeping missions sometimes are not sent in a timely manner, or because at times, they are not provided with adequate human, material and financial resources. Sometimes this is due to the ambiguity in the mission mandate itself. We recognize that the effectiveness of action in the area of peace and international security does not depend only on United Nations activities. There has to be renewed commitment on the part of each and every State. On this matter, I would like to applaud the recent publication of the Brahimi report. It is our understanding that the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels should be made part of this commitment in order to eliminate the sources of financing for local wars. In the particular case of the African continent, the continent most affected by the scourge of war, the illicit trade in diamonds has been the primary source of support for wars incited by some rebel groups with the objective of overturning democratically elected regimes. Some new initiatives have been launched with the aim of reducing access of these conflict diamonds to the international market. My Government supports these initiatives and will provide any cooperation necessary for their implementation. Another serious issue affecting international security is the circulation and transfer of small arms that flow to areas of conflict by way of rebel groups. This takes place with the connivance of certain Governments and networks of transnational organized crime. The lack of international legal instruments capable of controlling transactions of these arms is stimulating the creation of actual arms markets, above all in Africa. This is leading to an increased number of conflicts and making their resolution even more difficult. According to United Nations data, the effects of these arms on civil populations are shocking. They have already resulted in more deaths than the two world wars combined. In fact, the issue of conflict diamonds and the proliferation of small arms assumes special importance for Angola. It is through the sale of illegally mined diamonds that the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi reconstituted their war machine, with which they then undertook a large-scale military campaign aimed at taking power. That war campaign led to a procession of death and destruction, and it is the principal reason for the economic instability in Angola. This scenario is repeating itself in other regions of Africa and the world. For this reason, a solution is urgently required. The economic and social development and subsequent eradication of poverty, full respect for human rights, democracy and good governance can only be achieved in absolute conditions of peace and stability. It is in this context that my Government established, as a priority, the restoration of definitive peace in Angola. As a result of its efforts to attain this objective, the general situation in Angola has significantly improved. It is for this reason that today we are more confident than ever of a future of peace, development and prosperity. Indeed, the war has ceased to have the same intensity as it did several years ago, and the conflict itself is moving progressively towards an end. The political and military measures undertaken by the Government have significantly reduced the ability of the rebels to wage war. These measures have also allowed the Government to resume control over nearly the entire country. More than 12,000 rebel military personnel have abandoned their arms and joined the efforts of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Those who persist in waging war have less and less space, and their activities are limited today to isolated armed attacks against civilian targets, the objective being to destroy and loot the people's property. 13  The military measures undertaken by the Government represent a necessary and legitimate recourse designed to stop the violence unleashed by the rebels of UNITA, which put in jeopardy the very existence of the Angolan democratic system. However, despite the fact that the ongoing measures aimed at the total control of our national borders and the elimination of the remaining pockets of criminal armed groups are having a positive impact in the search for peace, they do not constitute our only option for the resolution of armed conflict. Simultaneously, we will continue to implement other actions aimed at guaranteeing the total implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, which for us continues to be a valid basis for the resolution of the Angolan problem. In this context, we reiterate our readiness to continue to integrate in our society all those who choose to abandon the option of war. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, still has an active role to play in the process of restoring peace in Angola, through the continued implementation and strengthening of sanctions against the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. The recent nomination by the Secretary-General of the members of the mechanism to monitor the application of sanctions against the UNITA rebels, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1295 (2000), will contribute to greater international vigilance regarding possible violations. It will deny bases of support to the armed rebellion in Angola. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will extend their cooperation to that body. The significant improvement of the situation in Angola, however, has not brought an immediate end to the effects of war on the lives of the people. The humanitarian situation continues to be critical, and for that reason we appeal to the international community to increase its assistance to the needy populations. The positive evolution of the situation is not limited to the politico-military field; it has also carried over into the macroeconomic sector. Angola continues on the path of economic reforms which have earned the confidence of international financial institutions. This progress translated to the recent signature of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund relating to the implementation of a monitored programme. We hope that the international community will contribute substantially through the investment of capital during the recovery phase of the Angolan economy in supporting stability and growth. Angola adopted legislation to protect foreign investment by providing incentives and guarantees. The international situation continues to be characterized by violence and tension in various parts of the world; they constitute a serious threat to peace and stability. Angola is seriously concerned by the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in view of the grave repercussions for stability and development in the central region of Africa. The situation in that neighbouring country, which shares more than 2,000 kilometres of common border with Angola, remains quite volatile and complex. It runs the risk of a serious worsening if appropriate measures are not taken. The resolution of the Congolese conflict must come about, fundamentally, through the implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. In spite of its shortcomings, which perhaps call for a new reading, it continues to be the only basis acceptable to all the parties involved. It respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Invading forces should withdraw completely from Congolese territory and cease immediately their support for the destabilization of that country. These conditions, in addition to the inter- Congolese dialogue, founded on a realistic base including the unequivocal recognition of the authority of the Government in Kinshasa, will be crucial for the success of the peace process. Angola reiterates its commitment to continue to make the necessary efforts, together with the mediator, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, and other parties to the Lusaka Agreement, until a way out of the conflict is found. In Sierra Leone, the prosecution of hostilities continues to delay the pacification of the country. Angola supports regional initiatives aimed at reactivating the peace process and condemns the attacks against United Nations personnel and forces. We support steps aimed at bringing to international justice the principal parties responsible for the atrocities committed against the people of that country. In Somalia, the progress reached at the national conference led to the re-establishment of some national institutions and moved the country closer to peace. 14  Angola encourages the continuation of these efforts and hopes that in the near future Somalia may be able to reassume, de facto, its rightful place in the international community. In the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has undergone some positive movement following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in Algiers. We hope that the two parties honour their commitments under the accord and create conditions for the establishment of good- neighbourly relations and cooperation. Similarly, we continue to be optimistic regarding the resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara through the implementation of the United Nations peace plan. Angola is following with particular attention the situation in Zimbabwe, our fraternal country, and supports the efforts of the Government of that country to find a just and fair solution to the land problem that was inherited from the colonial period. In this context, we share and fully support the position expressed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Non-Aligned Movement on land reform in Zimbabwe. In the Middle East, the question of Palestine constitutes the fundamental cause of conflict in the region. Angola reaffirms its support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. The resolution of this conflict must encompass a political compromise between the parties involved and the effective implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and other understandings reached. Less than a year ago, the people of East Timor finally succeeded in exercising their right to self- determination. Angola feels pleased and compensated by this historic accomplishment, since it was one of the countries that fought in the United Nations and other international forums for the right of the Timorese people to freely choose their own destiny. The international community, and the United Nations in particular, which is responsible for the management of the transition period, cannot permit the current climate of violence, provoked by the militias with the objective of impeding the independence of the territory, to impose itself over the will of a people that has already suffered for decades the scourge of colonialism and foreign domination. Angola strongly condemns these acts of violence, which have resulted in great loss of life, destruction and chaos. Angola appeals to the Security Council to take appropriate steps to ensure its immediate cessation. In the past two years, the world economy has registered a clear recovery since the crisis that shook Asia. The industrial economies and the so-called emerging markets are becoming stronger and achieving considerable rates of growth. However, the present world economic order continues to be marked by sharp distortions between North and South. While the North enjoys unprecedented prosperity, the South continues to suffer poverty and social injustice. Contributing to these ills are restrictive economic measures imposed unilaterally. The embargo imposed against Cuba is one example  its principal victims are the most vulnerable strata of its population. We will continue to support the lifting of the embargo. The international goal of reducing by one half, by the year 2015, the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty will require strenuous efforts, above all by the wealthiest countries and international financial institutions. In particular, it will be necessary to relieve the burden of external debt, whose service payments alone absorb a large part of the financial resources of developing countries. At the same time, steps will be necessary to attenuate the negative impact of globalization. Despite the fact that it has strengthened the spirit of community in international economic relations, globalization has benefited wealthy countries more than underdeveloped countries. The structural adjustment programmes under way in many developing countries should take account of real necessities and specifics, because many of the measures imposed by the international financial institutions have caused serious difficulties, above all of a social nature. To conclude my remarks, I would like to call attention to the need to pay more attention to the economic situation of the African continent. This should be done in such a way as to facilitate its integration into the world market, particularly through the transfer of technology and increasing productive investment."},{"index":"3","year":2000,"session":55,"country":"ALB","speech":"Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, and to express my strong conviction that, under your guidance, the work of this session will be conducted successfully. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the work carried out by your predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, and for his competent guidance of the previous session. At the start of the new millennium, Albania, as a sovereign and peace-loving country, is committed to making its modest contribution, in the activities of the community of countries Members of the United Nations, to greater peace, stability, security and economic prosperity. It has tried to do so by creating internal political and economic stability, as well as by pursuing a foreign policy aimed at achieving constructive cooperation with the countries of South- Eastern Europe and beyond. Since last year's session, Albania has been taking further steps towards consolidating its democratic institutions and constitutional order, strengthening and liberalizing its economy and consolidating and ensuring respect for human rights. Because of the efficient measures undertaken by the Albanian Government, and thanks to the help provided by our partners, Albania is recovering from the consequences of last year's conflict in Kosovo. Albania has become an open and safe country for foreign investment. The policies of the Albanian Government to privatize strategic sectors and absorb foreign capital are bearing fruit. The strengthening of security and public order, as well as the fight against organized crime, have reached satisfactory levels that are appreciated not only within my country, but elsewhere. The abrogation of the death penalty and the establishment of the office of Ombudsman have further raised the level of protection of and respect for human rights in Albania. Albania is currently on the eve of local elections, which will be of fundamental importance for the future development of the country  not because of the results so much as because of the way in which the elections will be conducted. For this reason, the Albanian Government, in close cooperation with specialized international institutions, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Development Programme and others, has made every effort to ensure that these elections are fair, free and democratic. Albania has clearly expressed its intention to play a primary and constructive role in the common attempts to transform the Balkans into a developed and stable region, clearly aiming at European integration. The policy of good-neighbourliness is not simply a requirement of geography but, above all, an eloquent expression of goodwill and mutual interest in the 8  protection of democratic institutions, fundamental freedoms, stability and prosperity in the region. Consequently, the Albanian Government has proceeded towards the creation of stable relations of mutual cooperation with Balkan countries, considering that to be a primary strategy for future European integration. Relations with these countries have been institutionalized not only bilaterally, but also multilaterally. Albania has placed at the core of these relations common economic, political and security interests, as well as respect for human freedoms and rights, including those of national minorities living in the territory of the Republic of Albania. It has tried to make inter-Balkan relations follow the model of existing relations among European Union member countries, with the free movement of people, goods and capital. More than a year after the bloody conflict in Kosovo that endangered peace and stability in the region, the Albanian Government is of the opinion that the situation in Kosovo has improved significantly since the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  the deployment of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the establishment of the United Nations administration. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have returned home, houses destroyed by the war have been rebuilt, the reconstruction of the economy and of the common administration institutions has begun and the political situation and order in the country have improved significantly. The current situation in Kosovo contradicts the sceptical and nihilistic opinions, expressed here and there, against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention in Kosovo and against the establishment of the United Nations administration there. Our memories of what happened in Kosovo a year ago will not fade, but will make us more conscious of the catastrophic consequences that the chauvinistic policy of a totalitarian regime can bring to an innocent civilian population. In order to make a contribution to the founding of a democratic society in Kosovo in which human and national rights are fully respected, we have established very close relations with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, KFOR and their representatives. Albanians, even more than other people in the region, wish for and will welcome the democratization of Serbia, because, historically, they have suffered more than others from Serbian nationalism. Often, however, wishes do not match up with reality, and we have to be realistic. Following very attentively the preparations for local elections in Kosovo, the Albanian Government expresses its conviction that the political forces in Kosovo will conduct their pre-electoral campaign in accordance with democratic principles and values, without acts of political violence. We would also like to express our sincere will for the full participation of the Serb community and of the other minorities in Kosovo in this electoral process because, as we have previously stated, we support a multi-ethnic and multicultural Kosovo. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the entire international community to apply stronger pressure against the Milosević regime in order to force him to release all 7,000 Albanian political prisoners and hostages being kept in the Serb prisons, to help bring the criminals who caused the massacres against the Kosovar population before the United Nations Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, to strengthen the international police presence and to work on strengthening judicial bodies in order to detect any kind of crime in Kosovo and combat it. I would also like to reiterate that the realization of United Nations goals for the fulfilment of the promises to start the reconstruction of the Kosovar economy is of special importance. It should be included in regional cooperation projects, especially in the framework of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. Although the Balkan political scenery has changed, and the countries of the region are engaged in a process of cooperation, there still exists a source of tension and conflict in the region, a source that has consequences for the countries of the region and beyond. It is Milosević's regime. He was not satisfied by the catastrophic 10-year-long conflicts that he personally set off in the former Yugoslavia; now he is destroying Serbia itself, as well as the remaining Yugoslavia. Next week, presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Serbia. The current situation there indicates that very little chance exists for them to be free and fair. The recent amendments to the Yugoslav Constitution, the brutal violence against the opposition and the student movement and the 9  censorship and closing down of independent media are explicit facts proving that Milosević may transform these elections into a tool for illegally maintaining power. Like all the rest of the international community, the Albanian Government looks forward to genuine democratic forces coming into power in Serbia, forces that possess new visions for the future of their country and of the whole region. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to thank Mr. Kouchner, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for the positive developments in Kosovo and for all that he and his staff are doing to stabilize Kosovo and to establish democratic institutions there. As a neighbouring country, Albania closely follows developments in Montenegro. It condemns Milosević's attempts to destabilize that Republic and to undermine the democratic and integrative processes that are being undertaken by the legitimate Montenegrin leadership. Following the good- neighbourliness principle of its foreign policy, the Albanian Government has recently developed intensively its cooperation with Montenegro. Current relations have reached the highest level ever known, having been extended to areas of mutual interest, such as political, economic and trade cooperation, the free movement of people and so forth. It is our intention to further extend and strengthen these relations in the future. The countries in our region are involved in an already irreversible process: Euro-Atlantic integration. Not only the Balkans, but also Western Europe, is now aware of the danger stemming from a divided Europe, of the danger stemming from a Balkan region that is not integrated into the European Union. The regional conflicts of the last decade are more than sufficient to understand this tendency. Stability in the Balkans is not only in the interest of its countries, but also in the interest of the European Union itself. An economically developed and democratically consolidated Balkans cannot exist without a Europeanized Balkans. The European integration of the Balkans and its development consist of an inseparable unity. It is of no importance whether a country tries to protect its democratic institutions, laws, public order or respect human rights; it can never attain the desired success if it is not economically developed. We are conscious that European integration is not an easy process; on the contrary, it is a long and difficult path. Before being integrated into the European Union, all the countries of our region should first be integrated among themselves, and existing societies in the Balkans should demonstrate and reflect the best features of European civilization. In order to achieve this, we should first combat and overcome extreme nationalistic concepts, mentalities and policies, because Europeanization means cooperation, tolerance and integration. The end of the conflict in Kosovo marked a turning point for the future of the Balkans. The Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe was the best response to the crisis in the region. Our countries, like the European Union member countries, consider this initiative an instrument and a bridge for the integration of South-Eastern Europe into the European structures. The Albanian Government regards the implementation of the Stability Pact as one of its main priorities. Albania is highly appreciated by its international partners for the engagement and the responsibility it has shown in drafting the feasibility studies for the Stability Pact projects. We hope that the strong political will expressed in Sarajevo last year at the end of the Kosovo conflict will be vigorously followed by the will to finalize financial support for the rapid implementation of the Stability Pact projects. Albania's achievements in its domestic and foreign policy in the year 2000 have only one goal: its further integration within Euro-Atlantic structures. The Albanian people have a clear European orientation, and that is why all Albanian Governments of the last 10 years have enjoyed their total support for their European integration policy. The present Albanian Government, representing and expressing the will of the people, has continuously fulfilled all the required conditions during the last year, aiming at reaching a higher level of relations with the European Union. We hope that in the near future the institutions of the European Union will approve the status report that the Albanian Government presented at Brussels several months ago. This approval will pave the way for the beginning of negotiations to reach Albania's association and stability agreement with the European Union. Albania's acceptance in the World Trade Organization in July this year was also an encouraging and very optimistic event in this respect. 10  The Albanian Government has welcomed the initiative of President Chirac to organize, on behalf of the European Union, a regional summit in Zagreb in November this year. It is another affirmation of common efforts to further advance the democratization and integration processes in the region and the consolidation of security and stability there. The new century has started. We should keep on facing old problems, along with our new challenges. Some of those may be local crises, organized crime, traffic in human beings, terrorism, arms control and so forth, all of which require practical and well-oriented cooperation. Bitter experiences in various regions of the world, such as the Balkans, Africa, South-East Asia and so forth, made the role of such organizations as the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others more evident. On the other hand, the world has entered the era of globalization. Despite its positive side, globalization is unavoidably accompanied by effects that may bring negative consequences, especially to small and poor countries. In order to avoid these consequences, it is necessary to compile and to implement global strategies, and the United Nations can easily do that. Only a week has passed since one of the most distinguished events for the international community, the Millennium Summit. It was a unique meeting of all the leaders of the world, where they affirmed their goodwill to cooperate in facing the challenges of the new millennium and in strengthening the United Nations. The Albanian Government hails the results of the Summit and expresses its conviction that all United Nations Member countries should unite all their forces for the fulfilment of the commitments embodied in the final Declaration of the Summit. Following is what the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, wrote in his report: We must do more than talk about our future, however. We must start to create it. (A/54/2000, para. 17) It is time to take concrete steps in this direction."},{"index":"4","year":2000,"session":55,"country":"AND","speech":"Andorra will become, through the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) rotation scheme, a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations at the beginning of 2001, for a period of three years. This is a great responsibility and a particular challenge for a small country that has only been a Member of the United Nations since 1993. My Minister of External Relations, Mr. Albert Pintat, would have loved to have been here today to express to Members Andorra's commitment to the goals of the United Nations and specially our obligations in ECOSOC. He would have praised the Brahimi report and its new thoughts on peacekeeping operations, which my country supports. When he learned that he would be unable to lead this year's delegation to the United Nations, owing to unavoidable official functions in Europe, he asked me, in the light of our forthcoming membership in ECOSOC, to contribute to this general debate of the year 2000 with some free reflections — if possible innovative ones — on what globalization might mean for a small State. This is a daunting task since everything seems to have been said about the subject, but I shall try to dutifully carry out my Minister's instructions. First, however, let me convey to President Harri Holkeri Albert Pintat's congratulations for his election as President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, while thanking his predecessor, Theo-Ben Gurirab, for a difficult job well done. When I was a student here in the United States many years ago, I took a course in photography. I had taken from my family's house in Andorra a negative — it was one of the older glass negatives — and there in the university photography lab I set it up for developing. I remember that moment when I peered into the developer tray and saw, slowly forming on the white photographic paper, an image, the image of my great grandmother. It was a shock, there in New Haven, to see this face from a long distant past, from long before I was born, come slowly into clarity. A lost image from a lost past. If I had the time, and Members the inclination, I could tell them about my great-grandmother, a formidable woman who never left the Valley of Andorra, high up in the mountains of the Pyrenees. I could tell them what her face, strong and hard as the stone of the mountains, says about the history of my country. In the photograph, she is dressed all in black, and looks away from the camera, down at the rocky ground. Behind her, one can see the stones of the 16  family farm, high up in the mountains above Saint Julia, one of the seven parishes that make up the Principality of Andorra. Her Andorra is very different from the country today. Dirt paths have become asphalt roads and stone- strewn fields are now covered with shops, houses and hotels. The remarkable Romanesque churches that are the pride of my country, churches that date back to the foundation of the Principality in the late thirteenth century and that loomed over the villages for almost a millennium, are now hemmed in by concrete buildings — stores, apartments, houses, the same buildings you might find in parts of Rio de Janeiro, Beijing or New York. Yes, so much has changed since my grandfather's hand snapped this picture. My great-grandmother would recognize only the church towers and the stones of the mountains. And what was so specific about her world — the stories, the cooking, the fabric of daily life — well, that has disappeared. In the space of 70 years, Andorra has changed from being a poor and remote place to a prosperous country, with over 10 million tourists a year, who come for skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. We are now a commercial hub. If you look for a country transformed by globalization, you might look to Andorra. Andorra is a country that has survived, independent and uninvaded, since 1278. It is one of the oldest and one of the smallest democracies in the world. A historian might argue that this remarkable fact is due to its isolation and poverty, or because for centuries the outside world was neatly balanced by its co-Princes — the Bishop of Urgell to the south, and to the north the Count of Foix, later the French King and since 1805 the head of the French State. Unsurprisingly, I might attribute the remarkable record of peace to the cautious character of the Andorran people. Or rather — and less partially — I think that because it is a small country, where parishes have been able to readily communicate with one another at the Casa de la Vall, the House of the Valleys, communication never broke down. The Millennium Summit of the United Nations had as its theme globalization. As a summit, it was aptly named, since I would say that globalization is the story of the second millennium — indeed perhaps it is the story of human culture. I am a politician, not a historian, but we all know the effect on both Europe and the Middle East wrought by the Crusades of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, or the transformation of indigenous and European cultures brought about by the “discovery” of the New World, or the effect of the slave trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on both Africa and the Americas. These violent encounters formed the world even as they brought death and destruction. They also sparked our imaginations. The Globe was the name of Shakespeare's playhouse in sixteenth-century London, a joke he liked to work into many of his plays. I like to think of the United Nations as the new Globe, a theatre in which we are the players or — if we have the imagination — the dramatists for the story of our fragile planet. But the globalization we are now facing is of a different nature. As Kofi Annan suggested in his opening introduction to the Millennium conference, the starting point for this millennium can be summed up in one word: “globalization” — the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village. It is an idyllic view, the view of the world as a village. Of course, the Secretary-General is all too aware of the negative effects of the process. In the same introduction, he cautions: “Globalization offers great opportunities, but at present its benefits are very unevenly distributed while its costs are borne by all. “Thus the central challenge we face today is to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people.” (A/54/2000, paras. 13 and 14) We all know the protests that have taken place, and will take place, against this same word, “globalization”. Let us listen, for instance, to one of the interested groups, chosen at random, the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), which understands the term as referring to a “globalized economic system dominated by supranational corporate trade and banking institutions that are not accountable to democratic processes or national Governments”. The IFG accuses “the GATT, WTO, Maastricht, NAFTA, combined with structural adjustment policies of the IMF and the World Bank, to be direct stimulants to the 17  processes that weaken democracy, create a world order that is under the control of transnational corporations, and that devastate the natural world”. According to the IFG, globalization brings the diminishment of powers of local and indigenous communities, States and even nations, destroys both small-scale agriculture and the earth's remaining wilderness, and brings a worldwide homogenization of diverse local and indigenous cultures. To counter its effects, the IFG advocates the revitalization of local communities by promoting maximum self-reliance, the recognition of rights of indigenous peoples and the abandonment of the paradigm of unlimited economic growth. When I listen to these words, I cannot help but hear a lament, a lament for a lost and simpler world: the world of my great-grandmother. And I am reminded of that greatest of all laments for lost culture, the work that indeed informs the thinking behind the activists who struggle against the forces of globalization — Claude Lévi-Strauss and his masterpiece, Tristes Tropiques, his elegy for the people of the Amazon basin, which even as he captured it on paper was disappearing into our modern world. I understand the sadness for the lost world, the world of the past that is always slipping away from us, that exists in the black-and-white negative of our memory. And so here I elegize, before this Assembly, all that has disappeared, not simply in Andorra but in the world, all that has been forgotten, paved over by the forces of travel, of tourism, of telephone, television, cinema and the Internet. These technologies link the world; they narrow its distances and threaten to dilute the cultures of the globe into a flat monoculture. And I ask my listeners now: what new discoveries await us? We cannot imagine them, but they will come, and sooner than we think, in this terrifying and beautiful globe of ours. And yet, and yet ... The IFG manifesto was not posted on a church door in Wittenburg, printed in a new technology that sparked another revolution, the Reformation of the sixteenth century. No, it was downloaded from a web site on the Internet. This Web — in which ideas, images, voices travel across our globe in a flash — is a remarkable invention that collapses both time and space. In the same way, I now realize that my image of my great-grandmother came from a negative, from a camera — a technology that perhaps more than any other, besides the computer, has transformed and quickened the pace of our world. This is to make a very simple point: not simply that this manifesto is presented in the very technology of globalization, but that nostalgia for a local economy might be a product of globalization itself. My great-grandmother had a good life, but a hard one, with terrible cold in the winter and constant work. Would she have chosen this life, if she could have had another? If she had known another? And more to the point, would she have been allowed to choose? We need to remember that people themselves have embraced change. Real people who are not content to live — physically or imaginatively — in their places of birth, but, filled with a desire to better their lives or to see the world, they reach out and try to grasp change, if only to know what they have lost. Lévi-Strauss could not bring himself to recognize that people he observed, deep in the Amazon rain forests, might want to leave their paradise — not because they were driven out by modernity, the modernity that Lévi-Strauss himself made so much of, but because they wanted to better their lives, to embrace the world, to feel for themselves the painful pulse of gain and loss. We need only leave this Hall and walk through any street in the city to recognize this. People from all across the world, people of all races, walking up and down, alone or in conversation, happy or unhappy, homesick or embracing the dreams this city seems to proffer. In the streets, we see restaurants that offer wonderful meals from all around the world, and fusion restaurants: French-Senegalese, American-Thai. Or fusion children. In the streets of New York or Paris or Hong Kong or Andorra la Vella, the people are changing, colours are shifting. What brave new world is being born around us? In saying this, I do not want to contradict the concerns of the anti-globalists, to in any way deny their recognition of the dangers of change. We ignore at our peril practical questions that turn around international finance, international corporations, the widening gulf between have and have-not countries, the dangers to the environment. 18  These are practical matters to be seen to. To paraphrase Annan, we need mechanisms to equalize the benefits of globalization, to make life a positive thing for all peoples. By this I do not mean the quest for superfluous material goods, but shelter and health and protection from disease. And I would add, simply, that before and during my tenure here as Ambassador, the United Nations hosted a series of summits or conferences designed to address these very problems — Rio, Istanbul, Copenhagen, Beijing, Rome, just to name a few. The world conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the world summit for children and Rio + 10 are to come. There is a substantial body of work in place to address the stresses of globalization. What we need to do now is continue to work towards our goals. In conclusion, I would like to consider a presupposition of both global optimists and pessimists: the notion that globalization has replaced nationalism. Again, to quote Kofi Annan, globalization means “the melting away of national boundaries as the world becomes one economy, one common space, one village”. Similarly, the report published in The New York Times concerning the protests against globalization stated that “speakers do not oppose globalization per se, because, in their view, the era of nation-States is coming to its inevitable end”. Are globalization and nationalism opposed? On the surface, they would appear to be. So much of globalization — economies that transcend borders, communication networks that shrink the world — seems to render an earlier model of the nation-State obsolete. And yet, whether it be the ethnic conflicts in Rwanda or in the Balkans, issues of immigration in the developed world or conflict in East Timor, we know that the question of the border, of the passport, remains increasingly important. Despite our interconnectedness, nationalism has not withered away. I fear the rise of a nationalism no longer linked to true patriotism, that is to the love of a place. I pray that the world does not succumb to an unthinking nationalism that would exist simply to exclude or to feed the ambitions of unscrupulous politicians. We need a democratic nationalism forged out of a concern for the rights of individuals. That is not nationalism as it worked out from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries — a nationalism linked to the struggle to control markets, to the scramble for loot — but a new nationalism that is not predicated on identity, on cultural sameness, a nationalism that is linked to a world economy that is no longer restricted by national borders, a democratic or civic nationalism, a global nationalism. This would be a new nationalism, I must add, in which Andorra and other small countries are not historical anachronisms, but are emblematic of this civic nationalism, predicated as it must be on the democratic will of the people. In this sense, Andorra's quiet patriotism, its 700 years of peace and communication, can modestly serve as a kind of historical model. Countries need to rethink what it means to be a nation in order to participate effectively in the life of this our globe, in order to become what we must be and to a certain extent already are: united nations. In its very name, in its very mission, the United Nations anticipated the globalization that is so rapidly occurring. Born out of a global threat posed by war and later by nuclear war, forged from the most terrible of national struggles, the United Nations is an activist forum for issues that are global, not in the sense that they transcend any individual nation, but in the sense that they are of concern to all nations. The International Criminal Court, whose statute will soon be ratified by Andorra, a country which had the honour of contributing to it by composing the first paragraphs of the preamble, is a good example of an entity that respects borders but that places human rights above all. Crimes against humanity must be punished, and shall be. This new nationalism, while it recognizes borders, asserts that the rights of citizens to liberty and peace are primary. Hence, the United Nations, even as it respects national borders, needs to recognize that it can and should become proactive in the protection of those rights in the case of civil conflict. So too, the great global threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases demands a response from each nation and a recognition that these threats can never be adequately dealt with alone, but only by working globally through the United Nations. In short, we need not only the United Nations, but, as many have said, we need united nations. 19  I began this speech with the image of my great- grandmother looking down at the stony ground of her country. I would end it, symbolically at least, with another image: our image. Someday, our great- grandchildren may discover our image, perhaps even our image here in this place. Perhaps they will reproduce it through a technology so strange, so remarkable, we cannot even imagine it. But let us hope that they live in the brave new world I have spoken of today. And let us hope that they see us as an image of positive change. We who have lived through such change cannot turn away from it. With our feet on the ground of this great globe of ours, we need to look forward. We need to grasp change. We need to reach out."},{"index":"5","year":2000,"session":55,"country":"ARE","speech":"I have the honour to convey to you, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere congratulations and regards on your election to the presidency of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your experience in international affairs will contribute to the success of this session's proceedings. We also thank your predecessor, His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Namibia, for the efficient manner in which 16  he directed the work of the previous session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary- General Kofi Annan for his prudent leadership and for the efforts he exerts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining peace, security and stability in the world. The convening of the Millennium Summit a few days ago in this world forum was a clear embodiment of the political will of the leaders of the world to deal effectively with the problems and challenges that face the international community, such as the proliferation of proscribed weapons, armed conflicts and increasing poverty and debt, as well as other attendant transnational issues, such as drugs, organized crime, international terrorism, environmental pollution, persistent violations of human rights and the disparities resulting from globalization and information technology. The consequences of these prevailing conditions have, more than ever before, reinforced our awareness of the importance of adhering to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and of consolidating the rule of international law through the peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the principle of equality and the right to self- determination, as well as of strengthening the spirit of cooperation and tolerance among the different cultures, beliefs and legacies of the various civilizations, for achieving the desired security, stability and human development. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its welcome of the border treaties concluded between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and both the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Yemen, as an important political and historic event that will promote confidence-building measures and good neighbourly relations. At the same time, we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow the example of those fraternal States and to respond to our peaceful initiatives that call for either entering into direct and serious bilateral negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful solution for ending Iran's occupation of our three islands Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, or agreeing to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice. In this context, we would like to reaffirm that all actions and measures taken unilaterally by the Islamic Republic of Iran on those three islands and its continued construction of military and civilian installations on them, are illegal measures considered null and void, and do not establish or entail any legal rights, regardless of the duration of the occupation. In fact, they represent a violation of the territorial sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates and contravene the principles and purposes of the Charters of both the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as declared Iranian peaceful intentions in the region. More than a year has elapsed since the Gulf Cooperation Council entrusted a tripartite Ministerial Committee, composed of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, with developing a mechanism for direct negotiations between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran has not yet responded to any of the endeavours of that Committee, thus preventing the reinforcement of the foundations of peace and security in the Arab Gulf region. Despite the fact that almost ten years have elapsed since the end of the second Gulf War, the Arab Gulf region is still experiencing the negative effects of that War. Consequently, it is imperative that political and diplomatic efforts continue in order to find a peaceful solution that would lead to ending the human suffering of the Iraqi people. At the same time, we invite the Iraqi Government to cooperate by completely fulfilling its obligations, particularly those relating to the release of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of war or detainees and to the restitution of Kuwaiti property, in implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council. In this regard, we would like to underline the importance of respecting the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of both Iraq and Kuwait, as well as refraining from the threat or use of force, in order to ensure the entrenchment of security and stability in the region. The Middle East peace process recently witnessed important developments during which major efforts were exerted with the objective of arriving at equitable and fair solutions based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. Yet, despite all those efforts and all the flexible and constructive proposals put forward by the Palestinian side for finding a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestine issue in all its aspects, the Israeli Government persisted in its positions of procrastination, delay and stalling, and in failing to 17  abide by the agreements it had concluded with the Palestinian side. Thus, in affirming our position of solidarity with the fraternal Palestinian people and their leadership, represented by the Palestinian Authority, we renew our call to the co-sponsors of the peace process — in particular the United States of America — and the other active States to continue exerting political and diplomatic efforts that support and promote negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, with the aim of finding a just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine issue. In particular this settlement should resolve the issues of Al-Quds Al- Sharif and the refugees, on the basis of Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). This should enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights to return to their homeland and to establish their own independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Also in this context we reaffirm our unceasing support of the position of sisterly Syria in its efforts to regain its Golan territory up to the line of 4 June 1967. We call on the international community to demand that Israel resume negotiations on the Syrian track on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, in the interest of attaining peace, stability and growth for all the States and peoples of the region. The United Arab Emirates, in welcoming once again fraternal Lebanon's regaining of its territory, expresses support for Lebanon's efforts to complete the extension of its sovereignty over all of its national soil. In the same vein, we support the demands of sisterly Libya that the economic sanctions imposed on it be lifted, particularly since it has implemented relevant Security Council resolutions. We also express our satisfaction at the outcome of the recent Somali reconciliation conference in Djibouti and invite all Somali factions to reinforce national unity for the sake of restoring peace, stability and sustainable development to Somalia and the rest of the region of the Horn of Africa. The growing number of problems resulting from the continuation of wars, disputes and ethnic cleansing in some parts of the African continent, the Balkans, South Asia, Afghanistan and other places is a source of constant concern for the international community. Consequently, we support all regional and international efforts aimed at dealing with these issues by peaceful means, and we emphasize that just and lasting resolution of these issues cannot be attained until the parties concerned demonstrate the necessary political will to achieve national reconciliation and demonstrate their commitment to implement relevant Security Council resolutions. Despite international unanimity, shown in the Disarmament Conference and other international forums, regarding the need to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, progress in this field remains slow, which is a matter of concern to us. We are particularly concerned at this time as some States are striving to outdo each other in stockpiling certain classes of these weapons, in particular nuclear arms and ballistic missiles, as a means of settling their territorial disputes. Since such actions escalate conflicts and disrupt the strategic security balance, at both the regional and international levels, we call upon the States concerned to review their policies in this respect and to promote the establishment of zones that are free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East, the Arab Gulf and the Indian Ocean. We also urge the international community to demand once again that the Israeli Government accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and agree to subject its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Despite the multidimensional changes that the world economy is witnessing as a result of the deregulation of markets, globalization and modern technology, the economic and social gap between the developed and developing States still exists and is growing — thereby exacerbating poverty and unemployment, environmental degradation and debt accumulation. Thus, the convening of the Millennium Summit and the Summit's Declaration highlight the great importance our countries attach to these issues. This makes it incumbent on all of us to work assiduously on carrying out the commitments and undertakings contained therein regarding the creation of an environment favourable to development, elimination of poverty and free access for the exports of the least developed countries to the markets of industrialized countries. I confirm the determination of the United Arab Emirates to support this plan and to 18  work towards narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. The United Arab Emirates continues its sustained efforts in support of economic- and social-development projects in many countries of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, be it through direct participation in financing such projects or by supporting international and regional efforts to attain those goals. Finally, the ever-increasing burden of economic, social and human development, which is the first safeguard of the political stability that we desire, demands that mechanisms for regional and international cooperation, foremost among which is the United Nations, be created. Hence, we call for continued efforts to carry out the structural reform and development of the world Organization, in particular the Security Council and the General Assembly, so that the Organization can keep pace with the rapid changes in international relations."},{"index":"6","year":2000,"session":55,"country":"ARG","speech":"In this, my first statement, allow me to congratulate Mr. Holkeri on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I believe that this is a timely opportunity to emphasize the great friendship that unites the Argentine Republic and Finland. I also express my gratitude to Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, another country that is a friend to Argentina, for the constructive way in which he presided over the Assembly's work at the last session. We also offer a cordial welcome to Tuvalu upon its entry into the United Nations and extend our friendship and cooperation to its people. This debate is taking place after a very productive exchange of opinions at the highest level during the Millennium Summit, which we hope will mark, together with the final Declaration, the beginning of a new era leading to a more equitable world and a more effective Organization, in accordance with objectives set out by the Secretary-General in his report entitled “We the peoples”. For my country, this is also an opportunity to set out before the General Assembly the principles and objectives of our foreign policy. The Government of President Fernando de la Rúa, who took office on 10 December 1999, has drafted a foreign policy on the basis of the mandate it received from the Argentine people. This policy aims at strengthening our integration with neighbouring countries, intensifying the hemispheric dialogue and promoting economic development, social progress, free trade and a ban on weapons of mass destruction. Argentina is determined to participate on the international scene jointly to build a peaceful and stable world based on the values of representative democracy, the rule of law, the protection and promotion of human rights, respect for the environment, economic liberalization, social progress, international cooperation and the maintenance of international peace and security, pursuant to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, as was stated at the Millennium Summit, these aspirations are shared by the vast majority of Members of this Organization. On the basis of its ongoing interests, the Government has set as a priority objective its political and economic integration with the other States members of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) — Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay — and associate members Chile and Bolivia. We have agreed with these countries to consolidate MERCOSUR by adopting the measures necessary to promote greater integration on the basis of balance and equity. We have made significant progress towards the expansion of our markets since the signing of the Treaty of Asuncin in 1991. This was the fruit of the determination of the member countries to implement an open trade policy in their economic programmes. 25  The creation of MERCOSUR was a political decision transcending the economic sphere. MERCOSUR provides a political forum within which trust, cooperation and the pursuit of full integration in all areas foster the increasing complementarity and convergence of our interests. Bolivia and Chile have bound themselves to MERCOSUR as associate members in the context of the Free Trade Area and we trust that they will become full members in the near future. As a consequence of the broadening political and economic dimensions of our integration project, we are also witnessing the convergence of approaches to defence and security in our region. This contributes to a continental perspective based on confidence and cooperation. We and our neighbours have made progress towards the creation of the joint MERCOSUR, Bolivian and Chilean zone of peace. Argentina is part of a nuclear-free Latin America reflecting the peaceful and cooperative security necessary to harmonious development. At the same time, as a member of the Rio Group, which has now grown to include Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, Argentina has pursued its high-level political consultations and cooperation in order to maintain peace, strengthen representative democracy and promote sustainable development in the region. It is our firm intention that our countries shall enjoy greater participation in the global economy. At the recent summit convened in Brasilia to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of Brazil, the Presidents of all the South American countries reaffirmed the spirit of understanding and harmony that marks its relations on the basis of these principles and objectives. The consolidation of democratic stability in Latin America continues to be a central policy of the Argentine Government. We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of others and we respect international law. We promote the consolidation of democratic processes on the basis of our deep conviction that free, regular and transparent elections and a plurality of political parties are essential instruments for affirming and guaranteeing the institutional nature of democracy. My country also reaffirms its commitment to eradicating poverty, inequity and social exclusion and to ensuring equal opportunity throughout the region. We shall continue to pursue our joint action in the regional and global campaign against drug trafficking, terrorism, corruption, the illegal trade in arms and organized crime. The Argentine Republic has a natural interest in the South Atlantic that is reflected in our participation in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic, comprised of 21 African and three Latin American countries. At the fifth ministerial meeting held in Buenos Aires in October 1998, a plan of action was adopted to implement our shared objectives in the peaceful settlement of disputes, economic cooperation, development, the conservation of fishery resources, the fight against drug trafficking and the protection of the environment. My country is in favour of free trade in order to achieve development and the eradication of poverty. The Argentine Government believes that protectionism not only generates the deflection of trade and the closure of markets, but also constitutes a form of discrimination. Argentina urges the entire international community to commit itself seriously to eliminating distortions of trade and will continue to fight for these objectives. In this regard, we believe that progress is being made in negotiations on the free trade agreement of the Americas to create a hemispheric free trade area by the year 2005. In the World Trade Organization, our country has provided new impetus to the efforts to launch a new round to broaden trade liberalization, particularly in agriculture. Argentina also continues to support negotiations to develop political and economic association between MERCOSUR and the European Union, including, in this framework, the gradual liberalization of agricultural trade and services. We are constantly seeking new ways to integrate ourselves with the world. The realities of technological change and continual innovation require developing countries to adapt to a scheme of international economic integration based on a new paradigm of production. The challenge is to ensure the access of the least developed countries to this process of constant technological change and innovation. There can be no doubt that the international community — in particular the United Nations — must cooperate to promote the transfer of technology from developed to developing countries with sufficient flexibility and breadth so that 26  technological innovations reach those countries with fewer resources. In his report “We the peoples”, the SecretaryGeneral quite rightly attaches great importance to this task. Without the adequate dissemination of and access to the new technologies of the digital revolution, we will see the gap between rich and poor widen. Individual States and the international community as a whole must therefore find solutions that guarantee greater fairness in the use of digital information. Argentina remains fully committed to the international community's efforts to protect the environment from the negative impact of human activities. In this regard we reaffirm our commitment to the principles of sustainable development agreed upon in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development — principles that were reflected in the Rio Declaration on the environment and in Agenda 21. Equally, we would like to stress the importance of making adequate preparation — during this very fifty-fifth General Assembly — for the conference to be held in 2002 to review the implementation of Agenda 21. Moreover, we feel it is necessary to consolidate the international legal regimes in the field of environmental protection. In this context, and bearing in mind the devastating consequences of atmospheric warming on the global ecosystem and on human life, we attach special importance to the entry into force, as soon as possible, of the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The twenty-first century was preceded by a prolonged strategic and ideological confrontation, which has given way to a moment in history in which representative democracy, human rights and open economies are shared values. At the same time, we are facing a more complex world that has yet to engender a stable international order. The explosion of serious intra-State conflicts — as we have seen in the Balkans or in Africa — are signs of the emergence of a new stage in conflicts — a stage in which, regrettably, conflicts are based on ethnic, cultural and religious differences. The Republic of Argentina aspires to contribute to achieving multilateral consensus aimed at reducing and neutralizing risks to peace and at facilitating the development of nations. We believe that if this consensus were based on greater democratization in international relations this would increase the efficacy and the functioning of the international system. Since it is impossible for individual States to face these threats alone, it is necessary to adopt cooperative security policies to eliminate the potential risk of conflicts and to strengthen the stability and security of legal regimes. It is essential that we face in a united fashion the immediate and underlying causes of conflicts, which often arise because of the lack of economic opportunities and because of social inequalities. The Members of the United Nations face the challenge of finding a response to questions raised by recent international crises, including the international humanitarian crises. My country believes that the principle of non-intervention must be duly respected because it is the pillar underpinning relations between independent States. At the same time, we cannot conceal our concern at the explosion of violence against ethnic, racial or religious minorities. In particular we are concerned about the situation of vulnerable groups, such as refugees and internally displaced persons, and about the situation of children in armed conflicts. Consequently we believe that the international community cannot remain indifferent and must provide an adequate response to humanitarian crises. We must emphasize the role that can be played by international tribunals to create awareness that impunity will not be tolerated. The International Criminal Court and the tribunals for Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone, which have been created, constitute important instruments of deterrence. In addition to the internal reforms that the Secretary-General has initiated with singular success within his sphere of competence, the United Nations must give priority to more democratic consensusbuilding in the decision-making processes of the main and subsidiary organs of the system. This needs to be done in a fashion that does not hamper the speed and effectively with which solutions are found to the daily problems facing the Organization. Maintenance of international peace and security is a primary responsibility of the Security Council, which must be strengthened. If these responsibilities are not fully shouldered, no other activity of the United 27  Nations can be carried out with any certainty of success. Since the inception of multilateral diplomacy, Argentina has defended the principle of the sovereign equality of States. It is therefore not surprising that our country maintains that the reform of the Security Council must be arrived at via consensus, and this consensus must not entail new discrimination, privileges or exclusions. The vast majority of the international community — seeking to ensure respect for the values of democracy and universality — believes that a new Security Council will have to allow for greater participation by all. This cannot be achieved if new permanent seats — like those established in 1945 — are established. Reform of the Council must allow all States a greater opportunity to participate in the Council, which must not be monopolized by only a few countries. For this reason, Argentina supports exclusively an increase in the number of nonpermanent members and the introduction of restrictions on the right of the veto, without losing sight of the ultimate objective of eliminating it altogether. We support the adoption of rules of procedure that guarantee transparency and the possibility of the participation of all Member States in this organ. Our support for the peaceful settlement of disputes continues to be a fundamental feature of our foreign policy. President de la Rúa reiterated the Argentine commitment to continue participating in peacekeeping operations established by the Security Council. The most recent conflicts have shown how important efficient training of the forces participating in these missions is. Experience acquired by Argentina in 42 years of participating in these missions is reflected in the creation of the joint Argentine centre for training for peacekeeping operations. It has been operating since 1995, with the participation of personnel from other Member States. We also established the centre for training of security forces for foreign missions. Argentina, which is currently involved in nine peacekeeping operations, places at the disposal of the United Nations its military and police training centres. We also support the initiatives to strengthen the rapid deployment capacity of the Organization, and we would support restructuring efforts aimed at optimizing the planning and support for peacekeeping operations both at Headquarters and in the field. My country was pleased to receive the conclusions and recommendations recently issued by the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and contained in the Brahimi report. These provide a valuable basis for building international consensus aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Organization to prevent conflicts and to maintain and re-establish peace. Argentina, which is part of the Bureau of the Special Committee for Peacekeeping Operations, supports the conducting, as soon as possible, of a detailed analysis of the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report — including its possible financial implications — with a view to achieving its early implementation. My Government is particularly concerned about the problems related to the security and protection of those who participate in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions. The personnel of the United Nations and associated personnel, as well as the personnel of other agencies that provide humanitarian assistance, are facing increasingly risks situations, as we have seen recently in the tragic events that have occurred around the world. Consequently, Argentina, which is a party to the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, has urged an improvement in the security situation of United Nations personnel via the adoption of practical and legal measures, including financial-planning and implementation measures for these operations. In this context we should also reiterate the duty of the international community to provide assistance to those countries facing emergency situations, which arise as a result either of natural disasters or of armed conflicts. In this area a significant role can be played by the “White Helmets” initiative, which involves the establishment of bodies of specialized volunteers organized by the Members of the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance to peoples who are victims of extreme emergencies and also to mitigate the serious problems that affect these people. We should also mention the issue of AIDS which particularly affects the poorest areas of the world. More than 34 million people suffer from this illness today. The virus has spread dramatically. In particular, more than two thirds of the victims are in sub-Saharan Africa. This pandemic is aggravating poverty. The illness and death of so many workers is draining already weakened economies. The impact of this phenomenon on the future of the affected regions will 28  probably mean greater marginalization and will undermine the foundations of stability, security and peace. The international community and this Organization and its specialized agencies must contribute urgently all available resources to the fight against this disease. I would like to refer in particular to the sovereignty dispute between my country and the United Kingdom regarding the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands as well as the surrounding seas. The recovery of the full exercise of sovereignty over this part of our national territory, respecting the interests of the inhabitants and international law, is a precept enshrined in the Constitution of Argentina. This item is on the agenda of the Organization, which in numerous resolutions has requested the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to renew negotiations to find a just and definitive solution to the sovereignty controversy, thus putting an end to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833. Today, in accordance with that request, Argentina reiterates once again its complete willingness to renew bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to resolve this question. We reiterate our support for the mission of good offices with which the General Assembly charged the Secretary-General to assist the parties in achieving this objective. The world stage in the post-cold-war era is the scene of ethnic conflicts, civil wars, massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, illegal traffic in arms and other threats. At the same, time we are seeing the unprecedented spread of representative democracy and economic and technological modernization. Against this backdrop, our main task is to reach agreements that will enable us to face these challenges and seize these opportunities in the best way possible. Equipping the United Nations for the challenges of the new millennium is the great task awaiting us. All Member States must undertake to fulfil this commitment if our efforts are to be crowned with success. Argentina is committed to this task and will continue making its contribution. On 31 December next, my country will end its term as a member of the Security Council. During its two-year term, Argentina has done its utmost to contribute constructively to decision-making and consensus-building on all items on the Council's agenda. On the basis of our potential and bearing in mind the features of the current international situation, Argentina intends, in the twenty-first century, to continue to play an active part in the consolidation of peace and international security and in the development of peoples."}],"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"string"},{"name":"year","type":"float"},{"name":"session","type":"float"},{"name":"country","type":"string"},{"name":"speech","type":"string"}],"pandas_version":"0.20.0","primaryKey":["index"]}},"total_rows":6,"truncation_type":null}},"metadata":{}}]},{"source":"##
