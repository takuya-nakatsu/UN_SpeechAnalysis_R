# UN_SpeechAnalysis_R
 This project aims to perform text classification on a corpus of UN General Debate speeches to identify speeches related to the United Nations using machine learning techniques. Three methods - Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest - are employed with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The final deliverable is a reproducible R notebook containing all code and descriptions of each step. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in computational social science and can be adapted for other text classification tasks.
